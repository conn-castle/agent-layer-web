# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## Unreleased

## v0.24.3 - 2026-10-07

### Fixed
- HerdR terminal conversation recovery now decodes public pane IDs using HerdR's native encoding instead of assuming decimal numbers. Valid pane IDs containing letters or multiple characters, such as `wV:pF`, previously failed stored-recipe verification before registration; Agent Layer now decodes them correctly so saved recipes are found for Claude, Codex, Antigravity, Muse, and Grok.

### Security
- Updated `golang.org/x/text` to `v0.41.0` to address GO-2026-6629.

### Development
- `make release-preflight` now validates documentation and the release tag, runs CI once, compiles unsigned release binaries for all four supported platforms (`darwin/arm64`, `darwin/amd64`, `linux/arm64`, `linux/amd64`) to a scratch directory, and scans them with `release-vuln-check` before tags are created. Build and scanner failures halt preflight, and failing artifacts are retained for diagnostics.

## v0.24.2 - 2026-10-07

### Fixed
- HerdR terminal conversation recovery now decodes public pane IDs using HerdR's native encoding instead of assuming decimal numbers. Valid pane IDs containing letters or multiple characters, such as `wV:pF`, previously failed stored-recipe verification before registration; Agent Layer now decodes them correctly so saved recipes are found for Claude, Codex, Antigravity, Muse, and Grok.

## v0.24.1 - 2026-10-07

### Fixed
- Codex conversation recovery in HerdR now works with Codex's native shared daemon enabled. The selected conversation registers on its first prompt, including loaded rejoin and selected child conversations, with the full hook ID and the correct pane's ordinary or source-development resume command. Background conversations and older suspended launches cannot overwrite the current foreground recipe; saved recipes survive HerdR restarts without another message.
- Grok model discovery in `al dispatch options`, the Agent Dispatch `dispatch_options` MCP tool, the wizard, and `al doctor` no longer reports `harness is not authenticated; sign in using al grok` when your Grok sign-in is valid but its access token has expired. `grok models` prints its sign-in status before it refreshes an expired token, and Agent Layer stopped reading at that status line and ended the process before the refresh finished. Discovery kept failing until a Grok session or dispatch refreshed the token. Discovery now lets `grok models` finish, and when the status line says you are not signed in, it runs `grok models` once more to read the refreshed state. The error now appears only when Grok still reports that you are not signed in after its refresh attempt.
- Agent Dispatch run records now report the provider version that actually ran after a launcher updates the binary it starts. Before each `start` or `continue`, Agent Dispatch checks the provider's version against its tested version and caches the result in `.agent-layer/state/dispatch-capabilities/cache.json`. Previously a cached version stayed in use as long as the command on `PATH` was unchanged, so with Muse's installed `~/.local/bin/muse` launcher, which updates a separate binary beside itself, run records kept reporting the old version (for example `1.4.0` while `muse --version` printed `1.4.3`), and the tested-version check used that stale value. Cached versions now expire after one hour, so dispatch reports an updated provider version within an hour of the update. Cache entries written by earlier Agent Layer versions are checked again on the next dispatch.
- VS Code settings sync rejects invalid JSONC before rewriting it while retaining the supported recovery of earlier managed blocks.

### Development
- Agent Dispatch tests isolate mock CLIs and workers, preventing recursive suite launches, accidental real-provider execution, and leaked workers after timeout. Release certification reuses or waits for the exact main-push run before dispatching another.

## v0.24.0 - 2026-10-05

### Added
- Terminal conversation recovery with HerdR for Claude, Codex, Antigravity, Muse, and Grok. When you start one of these clients with `al claude`, `al codex`, `al agy`, `al muse`, or `al grok` inside a HerdR pane, Agent Layer reports that conversation's resume command to HerdR. When HerdR restores the pane, it runs that command, such as `al claude --resume <session-id>` or `al codex resume <session-id>`, from the project directory, so the same conversation resumes under the project's current Agent Layer configuration and environment. Per-launch flags are not replayed, and prompts, credentials, and environment snapshots are never saved. A conversation registers at its first client event that carries a session ID, so Muse resumed by hand registers at its first prompt and Antigravity at its first invocation. Agent Layer reports success only after HerdR's saved session file contains the resume command, which normally takes a few seconds; a rejected, stale, or unsaved report fails with a diagnostic. If `HERDR_ENV=1` is set without `HERDR_SOCKET_PATH` and `HERDR_PANE_ID`, the launch command stops with an error. VS Code, Claude VS Code, and Copilot CLI sessions are not covered, and dispatched agents and subagents never register.
- HerdR recovery hooks: `al sync` (and the sync before each launch command) installs a recovery hook for every enabled terminal client whether or not you use HerdR: a `SessionStart` hook in `.claude/settings.json` when `agents.claude` is enabled, a marked `[[hooks.SessionStart]]` block in `.codex/config.toml` when `agents.codex` is enabled, a `PreInvocation` hook in `.agy/config/hooks.json` for Antigravity, `SessionStart` and `UserPromptSubmit` hooks in `.muse/hooks.json` for Muse, and `.grok/hooks/agent-layer-herdr.json` for Grok. Each hook runs `al hook herdr` from your `PATH` on those client events, including when you start the client directly, and does nothing unless an `al` launch command started that session inside a HerdR pane. Your other hooks are kept, including `hooks.SessionStart` entries you set through `agents.codex.agent_specific`, and repeated syncs keep exactly one managed hook per client. Disabling a client removes its hook on the next sync. Recovery still depends on each client's own hook trust and sign-in.
- The built-in Agent Dispatch MCP server now records its lifecycle on disk, so you can investigate a dropped connection after the session ends. Each server instance creates `.agent-layer/state/dispatch-mcp/<connection-id>.jsonl` in an owner-only directory (`0700`) with an owner-only file (`0600`). It records `start` before registering its tools, `error` for a startup failure or an observed read or write failure, and `stop` with a stop condition such as `client_eof`, `transport_error`, `context_cancelled`, or `completion_unknown` when serving returns. Records contain only the time, connection ID, Agent Layer version, process and parent process IDs, and fixed categories; prompts, tool requests and responses, raw error text, credentials, and environment values are never written. Read the files with any text editor or JSON Lines tool; no `al` command displays them. They are never deleted automatically, so remove them when you no longer need them. An abrupt kill, such as `SIGKILL` or an out-of-memory kill, leaves no `stop` record. On Unix, a broken stdout pipe is now recorded as a write failure instead of killing the server immediately. If a record cannot be written, the server prints a warning on stderr and keeps serving. `docs/AGENT-DISPATCH.md` describes each field and stop condition under "MCP server lifecycle diagnostics".

### Changed
- `AL_DOWNLOAD_TIMEOUT` (default `30s`) now limits how long a download of a pinned `al` release may go without receiving data, instead of limiting the whole download. Each download is capped at 10 minutes (longer when `AL_DOWNLOAD_TIMEOUT` is 5 minutes or more), and a stalled download reports timeout remediation. A second `al` process waiting for another process to download the same version now waits up to about 20 minutes, previously about 2, before giving up. This fixes running a command in a repo pinned to a version that is not cached, or running `al upgrade prefetch`, on a slow connection that needs more than 30 seconds to download the ~20 MB binary. Previously the download was cut off while data was still arriving, retried from the start, and failed with a generic `context deadline exceeded (Client.Timeout ... while reading body)` error.
- `al init --version` now rejects a version other than the running release CLI, including a `--version latest` that resolves to a newer release, before checking the release or writing any files. `al upgrade --version` and `al upgrade plan --version` now reject a version older than the running release CLI. Previously both commands reported success but wrote the running CLI's templates under the requested pin. With an older pin, every later command, including `al wizard`, ran that older binary against newer files and could fail on `config.toml` keys it does not know, and `al upgrade` also recorded those templates as the older release's managed baseline. With a newer `al init` pin, a later `al upgrade` treated the repository as already on that release and could skip migrations it still needed. To pin a different release, run `al init` or `al upgrade` with that release's CLI, or restore a snapshot with `al upgrade rollback <snapshot-id>`. Development builds can still target any version.
- `al dispatch`, `al benchmark`, `al probe`, and `al upgrade` now fail with `unknown command` and a nonzero exit status when given a mistyped subcommand, such as `al dispatch wiat`, and `al upgrade` also rejects a stray argument, such as `al upgrade rollbak <id>` or `al upgrade pln`. Previously `al dispatch`, `al benchmark`, and `al probe` printed help and exited 0, so a script read the typo as success. `al upgrade` ignored the extra word and ran a real upgrade, writing an upgrade snapshot and the updated templates and reporting `Upgrade successful.`, so a mistyped rollback upgraded the repository instead. Running `al dispatch`, `al benchmark`, or `al probe` without a subcommand still prints help.
- With `approvals.mode` set to `all` or `commands`, VS Code now auto-approves a `commands.allow` entry only when the command is the entry alone or the entry followed by a space or tab and arguments. Newlines and other whitespace do not count as argument separators. Previously the generated `chat.tools.terminal.autoApprove` pattern only required a word boundary after the entry, so the default `git`, `node`, and `make` entries also auto-approved different programs such as `git-filter-repo --force`, `node-gyp rebuild`, and `make.sh`, while an entry ending in punctuation, such as `go test ./...`, approved only the bare command and prompted for `go test ./... -run TestFoo`. Run `al sync` to regenerate `.vscode/settings.json`; a program that VS Code approved only through a shared prefix now prompts unless you add it to `commands.allow`.
- `al sync` with Muse enabled now rejects a `commands.allow` entry where an unquoted `#` starts an argument, such as `git push origin #123` or `git log # recent`, before writing any files. Previously Muse treated the `#` and everything after it as a shell comment and auto-approved the shorter prefix, such as every `git push origin` command, while Claude and Codex kept the whole entry. Quote a literal `#` argument, as in `git push origin '#123'`; a `#` inside an argument, such as `a#b`, is unaffected. If an earlier sync already wrote the shorter rule, Muse keeps approving it until you fix the entry and run `al sync` again.
- `al sync`, the sync before `al claude`, `al codex`, and the other launch commands, and the `al doctor` MCP connectivity check now resolve MCP `${VAR}` placeholders from your process environment, as documented, with `.agent-layer/.env` filling only missing or empty values. Previously they read only `.agent-layer/.env`, so a secret exported in your shell failed with `missing environment variables` even though `al doctor` reported it as found. When a key is set in both places, Codex `.codex/config.toml` and Muse `.mcp.json` entries now embed the process value instead of the `.env` value.
- The `ship-pr` skill, and the merge-authorization reference used by `auto-skill-loop`, now require a ledger of every eligible review request before asking you to authorize a merge, including a request inside an automated approval, review summary, or pre-merge checklist. Each entry lists the request's source link, its disposition with evidence, and a posted reply that begins with `Fixed in <full commit SHA>.`, `Deferred.`, or `Disagreed.`; the merge gate refuses an incomplete ledger. Previously a request inside an approval that was summarized as having no actionable comments could be skipped. Run `al upgrade` to update installed copies of these skills.

### Security
- `al doctor` no longer prints secrets from `.agent-layer/.env` or your shell environment when it cannot reach an MCP server. Previously a connection or tool-listing failure echoed the resolved request, so a server URL such as `https://mcp.tavily.com/mcp/?tavilyApiKey=${AL_TAVILY_API_KEY}`, the shape the wizard's Tavily entry uses, appeared with the real API key in the progress line and the `MCP_SERVER_UNREACHABLE` warning whenever doctor ran offline, behind a blocking proxy, or against a failing server. Doctor now replaces every value it substituted into a server's URL, headers, command, arguments, or environment with the `${NAME}` placeholder from `config.toml`, as `al skills` already does for repository credentials. `${AL_REPO_ROOT}` paths stay visible. If you shared earlier `al doctor` output, rotate any key it contained.
- `al sync` (and the sync before `al agy`), `al agy`, and Antigravity dispatch now keep the Antigravity home `.agy/` owner-only (`0700`). Previously sync created `.agy/` with default permissions, such as `0755`, before `al agy` could restrict it, and an existing directory was never tightened, so other local users could list it and read files `agy` stores there without owner-only permissions, such as conversation summaries and logs. Sync and launch now create `.agy/` as owner-only and tighten an existing real directory that grants group or other access; files inside it are left unchanged. `al agy`, Antigravity dispatch, and wizard model discovery now also reject a symlinked `.agy/`, which `al sync` already rejected.

### Fixed
- `al sync` (and the sync before `al codex` and the other launch commands) no longer fails with `generated Codex config is invalid TOML: toml: key SessionStart already exists as a value, but should be an array table` when Codex is enabled and `[agents.codex.agent_specific.hooks]` sets `SessionStart = []`. The same failure, naming `Stop`, happened with `Stop = []` while `notifications.chime` is enabled. An empty list adds no hooks of its own, but sync wrote it beside the hook that Agent Layer adds for that event, which TOML does not allow. Sync now leaves the empty list out, so `.codex/config.toml` holds only Agent Layer's hook for that event. Non-empty lists are kept as before.
- `al update` on a Linux Homebrew (Linuxbrew) installation now reports the version that Homebrew just installed. Previously the completion message checked the binary in the old version's Cellar folder, because Linux reports the running program's resolved path rather than the `bin/al` link. It printed `Warning: could not determine installed CLI version` and `v1.0.0 -> unknown` when Homebrew had removed the old version, or the old version, such as `v1.0.0 -> v1.0.0`, when Homebrew kept it. The update itself succeeded either way. The check now runs the formula's `opt/agent-layer/bin/al` link, which the upgrade points at the new version.
- `al upgrade plan` no longer fails with `invalid pin version` when `.agent-layer/al.version` holds an invalid pin, such as merge-conflict markers or `not-a-version`, and a managed file you changed has no recorded baseline, as in a fresh clone where `.agent-layer/state/managed-baseline.json` is not committed. Previously the dry run stopped with exit status 1, although `al upgrade` itself repairs such a pin. The plan now treats the invalid pin as no pin: the file is reported with no baseline, and the pin row shows the invalid text that the upgrade replaces. A pin file that cannot be read still fails the plan.
- `al sync` (and the sync before `al vscode`, `al claude`, and the other launch commands) no longer writes an invalid `.vscode/settings.json` when one of your settings sits right before an Agent Layer managed block that held only comments, and the next sync adds a setting to that block. This happens, for example, after switching `approvals.mode` to `yolo` or enabling `agents.vscode` when the block was empty. VS Code can add a new setting to an object with no other settings right after `{`, which places it before the block without a comma. Previously sync wrote the managed setting without a comma between the two, so VS Code reported the file as invalid, and later syncs left it broken. Sync now adds that comma after your setting's value, before any trailing comment. Run `al sync` to repair a file that an earlier sync broke this way.
- `al wizard` keeps section-style MCP server sub-tables such as `[mcp.servers.headers]` and `[mcp.servers.env]` with the server they belong to, and removes transport-incompatible ones while repairing server entries; previously applying the wizard moved them to the last server and dropped repeated ones, which could send one server's credentials to another server.
- `al skills remove` no longer reports success while the removed selector stays in `.agent-layer/config.toml` when that file declares its imports in valid TOML other than a plain `[[skills.imports]]` header, such as `imports = [{ repository = "...", selectors = ["skills/a"] }]` under `[skills]` or `[[skills."imports"]]`. Previously remove deleted the skill and its lock entry but left the config unchanged, so the next `al skills pull` imported the skill again. Adding a selector to such an import failed with a confusing `key imports already exists` or duplicate-block error. Both commands now stop before changing anything and ask you to give that import its own `[[skills.imports]]` header; imports for other repositories or policies are unaffected. If an earlier remove left the selector configured, rewrite the entry that way and run `al skills remove` again.
- `al benchmark run` no longer records a paid Pier run as succeeded when its verifier failed and Docker cleanup also failed. Previously the cleanup failure took precedence: the run got a succeeded execution receipt and the retained staging directory, including the exact `model.patch` needed to replay the verifier, was deleted, so every later invocation failed that cell with `execution failed` and could neither replay the verifier nor resume it. A verifier failure after a proven provider completion now keeps the checkpoint and staging directory for verifier-only replay, which cleans up the leftover Docker resources first; an agent-phase failure gets a failed receipt that a later invocation can resume. The error now reports both the verifier and the cleanup failure.
- `al upgrade rollback <snapshot-id>`, and the automatic rollback after a failed `al upgrade`, now restore files inside a symlinked `.agent-layer/skills/` or `.agent-layer/instructions/` directory, such as `.agent-layer/skills -> ../shared-skills`. Previously, when an upgrade migration changed a file through such a link (for example the rename of `skills/agent-dispatch/` to `skills/dispatch-agent/`), rollback deleted the original files in the link's target, then failed with `inspect restored directory ... no such file or directory`. Every retry failed the same way, so the files survived only inside the snapshot. Rollback now recreates the link first and restores the files through it. Rollback also now stops with `ancestor that resolves outside repo root`, before writing, when a restored link would lead a write outside the repository. If an earlier rollback failed this way, run `al upgrade rollback <snapshot-id>` again; the snapshot still holds the files.
- `al sync` (and the sync before `al codex`, `al claude`, and the other launch commands) and `al wizard` now read a TOML multiline string correctly when it ends with a quote character right before its closing delimiter, such as `developer_instructions = """Always end with "Done.""""` in `.codex/config.toml` or `.agent-layer/config.toml`. TOML treats those extra quotes as part of the string. Previously Agent Layer ended the string at the first `"""` or `'''`, which threw off how it read the rest of the file: a later multiline string's text was read as config, and the tables after that string were read as part of it. As a result, sync could keep an `[mcp_servers.*]` table in `.codex/config.toml` for a server you had removed, `al wizard` could fail with `table approvals already exists` or move sections, and sync could misread `.grok-config/config.toml` when setting `[compat.claude] agents = false`. Run `al sync` to remove stale Codex entries.
- `al upgrade plan` and the "overwrite all managed files" review in `al upgrade` now list a file that an upgrade migration renames when its content differs from the new template, such as a customized `.agent-layer/instructions/02_memory.md` that becomes `01_memory.md`, or a file under `.agent-layer/skills/agent-dispatch/` or `.agent-layer/skills/playwright-cli/` that moves to `dispatch-agent/` or `playwright/`. The file is listed at its new path with a diff from your current content. Previously both reviews hid it, but approving "overwrite all", or running `al upgrade --yes --apply-managed-updates`, still replaced it with the template, so your customizations were lost without being shown. A moved file that already matches the new template is still not listed. If an earlier upgrade already replaced such a file, `al upgrade rollback --list` shows that upgrade's snapshot, and `al upgrade rollback <snapshot-id>` restores the files that upgrade changed.
- `al sync` (and the sync before `al codex`, `al claude`, and the other launch commands) no longer fails with `merged Codex config is invalid TOML: toml: table features already exists as defined by a dotted key` when your `.codex/config.toml` defines a table that Agent Layer writes into using only dotted keys, such as `features.multi_agent = true` or `tui.notifications = true` at the top level. Previously sync added a separate `[features]` or `[tui]` header for a new managed key, such as `features.apps` or `tui.status_line`, which TOML forbids next to those dotted keys. The same applied to `agents.codex.agent_specific` values, such as `model_providers.foo.base_url` beside `model_providers.foo.name = "Foo"`. Sync now writes the new key as a dotted key next to yours, such as `features.apps = false`, and leaves your entries unchanged.
- `al skills push` no longer publishes an imported skill that a `!` exclusion in its import block deselected, such as `skills/secret` under `selectors = ["skills/*", "!skills/secret"]`. Previously push still sent that skill's local edits to the configured destination, even after `al skills pull` had reported it as no longer selected with local changes. When the destination was the tracked source ref itself, the pushed lock then marked those edits as clean upstream content, so the next pull deleted the local copy. Push now reports such a skill as `skipped` and leaves its directory and lock entry unchanged. Run `al skills pull` to apply retirement rules: a clean skill is removed, and a modified one is kept for you to move into `.agent-layer/skills/` or delete. If an earlier push already published excluded content, remove it from the destination yourself.
- With `approvals.mode` set to `all` or `mcp`, Claude now auto-approves MCP servers whose ID contains a character outside letters, digits, `_`, and `-`, such as `docs.internal` or `team/api`. Claude Code replaces each such character with `_` in its tool names (for example `mcp__docs_internal__search`) and matches approval rules against that name. Previously `.claude/settings.json` and the `--allowedTools` flags passed by `al dispatch` used the raw ID (`mcp__docs.internal__*`), so the rule never matched: interactive sessions prompted for every call, and a dispatched Claude agent that used the server failed with denied tool calls. Run `al sync` to regenerate `.claude/settings.json`. Grok rules are unchanged.
- `al organize-scratch` no longer moves a bare Git repository, such as `proj.git` from `git clone --bare`, as ordinary data. Previously it was filed under `artifacts/evidence` and moved even without `--move-worktrees`, which broke every linked worktree created from it with `fatal: not a git repository`. A bare repository is now protected like a main checkout: it is left in place by default, and `--move-worktrees` moves it to `review/checkouts/` and repairs its linked worktrees. A non-bare git directory created with `git init --separate-git-dir` is never moved, because Git cannot reconnect its work tree afterwards; neither is a bare repository that `safe.bareRepository=explicit` stops Git from opening. A detected git directory is also left in place when moving it would break a symlink inside it, such as `objects` pointing at an external store, even with `--move-worktrees`. To fix a worktree that an earlier run broke, run `git -C <moved repository> worktree repair <worktree>`.
- `al dispatch` no longer fails a finished run with `provider did not exit and close output streams within 5s of terminal evidence or shutdown` when the provider streams output quickly in many small pieces, as Grok and Claude do token by token. Previously Agent Layer rewrote and synced the run record for every streamed piece, so a fast stream could fall seconds behind; after the provider exited, catching up took longer than the 5-second shutdown window and the completed answer was discarded. Progress-only events now update the recorded `last_activity_at` at most once per second, so it can trail the latest event by up to a second.
- `al dispatch` to Claude no longer kills work that Claude is still running in the background, such as a backgrounded `make ci` or a background subagent, five seconds after Claude reports a result. Previously Claude's report for the turn that started the work, for example "`make ci` is running in the background", ended the dispatch: the background work was killed and the run failed with `provider did not exit and close output streams within 5s of terminal evidence or shutdown`. Dispatch now waits while Claude keeps the work running and returns Claude's later result. Terminal task updates clear outstanding tasks even when Claude omits the notification. If Claude exits without a later result, the latest successful result is the final answer unless a tracked task reported `stopped`, `killed`, or `failed` after it; dispatch fails in that case. The unlimited Claude wait applies to subagents and workflows; Claude can still stop background Bash about five seconds after its result, so run required commands such as `make ci` in the foreground.
- Pressing Ctrl-C, or sending SIGTERM, while `al` downloads the version pinned in `.agent-layer/al.version` (or set by `AL_VERSION`), or waits for another `al` process to finish that download, now stops the command with a nonzero exit status. `al upgrade prefetch` stops the same way. Previously the interrupt was ignored until the download and its retry finished or the lock wait ended, and if the pinned binary was then available, `al` ran the interrupted command with it. A partial download is discarded, so the next run downloads the version again.
- `al upgrade` now writes the VS Code launchers in `.agent-layer/` (`open-vscode.command`, `open-vscode.sh`, `open-vscode.desktop`, and `open-vscode.app/`) only when `agents.vscode` is enabled, as `al sync` already did. Previously every upgrade recreated them with VS Code disabled, and the next `al upgrade plan` reported them as disabled-agent files to remove, so following that advice never cleared the warning. Launchers already on disk are left in place; delete them if you do not use VS Code.
- `al claude`, `al codex`, `al vscode`, and the other launch commands, as well as `al dispatch` agents, now take a secret from `.agent-layer/.env` when your shell exports that variable with an empty value, such as `export AL_TOKEN=`. `al sync` and `al doctor` already used the `.env` value in that case. Previously the agent started with the empty value, so an MCP server header like `Authorization: Bearer ${AL_TOKEN}` reached the server as `Bearer ` and authentication failed, even though sync succeeded and doctor reported the secret as found. A non-empty shell value still wins.
- `al doctor` now checks secrets for and connects to only the MCP servers that `al sync` writes for at least one enabled client. Only those servers count toward MCP warning thresholds and the size summary. Previously a server whose `clients` list named only disabled clients, such as `clients = ["codex"]` with Codex and VS Code disabled, was still checked: a secret it referenced but you never set failed doctor with `Missing secret`, and also made the MCP check skip every other server and report the MCP size as unavailable, even though `al sync` succeeded.
- The Agent Dispatch MCP tools `dispatch_start` and `dispatch_continue` now check the request context once at the start of publication, after preparation and before writing the worker request or launching the worker. Cancellation or the server's tool timeout observed at that checkpoint fails the call without launching a worker or contacting the provider; `dispatch_continue` preserves the current invocation for a retry. This covers cancellation during slow preparation, including waiting for the project lock and refreshing generated files, which previously could leave an unsupervised agent running after the caller received an error. Cancellation or timeout after the check, including before the launch call, can still return an error while the agent runs.
- `al sync` (and the sync before `al codex`) no longer duplicates `agents.codex.agent_specific` hook groups such as `hooks.Stop` in `.codex/config.toml` on every sync when the chime is enabled, and no longer fails with an invalid-TOML error after an `agent_specific` array-of-tables value is edited.
- Concurrent `al dispatch start` and `al dispatch reserve` calls no longer fail with `dispatch session "<name>" was not found` or `read dispatch mapping` when they prune expired sessions at the same time or one of them is creating a new session. Session mappings are now published only once complete, so a process that dies while reserving a name no longer leaves an empty mapping that fails every later start. Unreadable-mapping errors now name the affected session.
- `al init` and `al upgrade` now read `.agent-layer/al.version` as documented, ignoring blank lines and `#` comments like version dispatch already did. Previously a commented pin was treated as invalid, so `al upgrade` could not determine the starting version on a fresh clone and skipped version-gated migrations, `al upgrade plan` could fail with `invalid pin version`, and an already-matching pin was rewritten with an auto-repair warning.
- `al sync` (and the sync before `al claude`) no longer deletes `.claude/statusline.sh`. No Agent Layer release generated that file, so it belongs to you, for example a script you wire in through `agents.claude.agent_specific.statusLine`. Sync still removes its own `.claude/claude-statusline.sh` when the managed statusline is disabled.
- `al doctor` now checks imported skills in `.agent-layer/skills-imported/` the way `al sync` does. Previously it ignored them: it reported `No skills configured` or passed while sync failed on an invalid imported skill, an imported directory with no `skills.lock.json` entry, a malformed `skills.lock.json`, or a skill name present in both tiers, and the skill catalog warning and size summary left out imported skills.
- `al benchmark run` no longer blocks a study when Docker cleanup fails after a successful paid Pier run. The next invocation retried the cleanup and recovered the result without a provider call, but left the execution receipt reporting the failed cleanup, so every later progress check, report, and `--recover-only` run rejected the cell as conflicting evidence. Recovery now records the successful cleanup in the receipt. A study already stuck this way recovers after deleting that cell's `result.json` and rerunning `al benchmark run`, which still makes no provider call.
- `al skills pull` and `al skills push` now report a file on one side and a same-named directory on the other (for example a local `scripts` file while upstream adds `scripts/run.sh`) as a `file/directory` conflict for that skill, with a resolution workspace for `al skills resolve`. Previously the merge accepted both, so pull failed every skill with `not a directory`, discarded unrelated updates, and kept failing until the file was removed by hand.
- The generated Linux launcher `.agent-layer/open-vscode.desktop` now opens VS Code when launched from GNOME Files or `gio launch`. Its `Exec` line uses specification-compliant quoting and includes an absolute fallback path to the sibling `open-vscode.sh` for GLib versions that leave `%k` empty. Run `al sync` to regenerate the launcher; run it again after moving the repository if your launcher does not supply `%k`.
- `al dispatch` errors, Agent Dispatch MCP tool errors, and the `terminal_reason` of a failed dispatch run now include the underlying cause. Previously many failures reported only a label such as `read dispatch prompt file`, `prepare Grok home`, or `start dispatch worker`, without the path or the operating-system error, so a caller could not tell what to fix.
- `al upgrade repair-gitignore-block` now keeps whether `/.agent-layer/` and `/docs/agent-layer/` are ignored, as `al upgrade` already did. Previously it reset both to the template defaults without saying so, so private project memory in `docs/agent-layer/` could become committable and a committed `.agent-layer/` was ignored again. A choice is kept when the old block has exactly one line for that pattern, commented or not; otherwise that entry gets the template default.
- `al organize-scratch --move-worktrees --apply` now repairs a Git checkout and its linked worktree when both are moved in the same run, such as `repo` and the sibling `repo-wt` that `git worktree add ../repo-wt` creates. Previously the command exited nonzero and left the moved worktree broken and marked prunable, so a later `git worktree prune` or `git gc` could delete its HEAD and index, and the repair command it printed used the pre-move path. To fix a worktree that an earlier run broke, run `git -C <moved checkout> worktree repair <moved worktree>`.
- `al skills diff` now shows content changes even when a skill's own `.gitattributes`, or your global Git attributes file, marks files as binary or non-diffable (for example `* -diff`). Previously an upstream skill could hide changed instructions or scripts behind `Binary files … differ` in the diff meant to review them.
- `al upgrade rollback` now also restores `.agent-layer/state/managed-baseline.json`, or removes it if the upgrade created it. Previously the rollback left the baseline at the newer version, so the next `al upgrade` of an unpinned repository could skip migrations it still needed, and in a pinned repository restored templates could be reported as local customizations. Snapshots taken before this fix don't include the baseline, so rolling one of them back works as it did before.
- `al wizard` no longer deletes `noise_mode` and `version_update_on_sync` when you answer No to the warnings prompt. Previously declining warnings removed the whole `[warnings]` section, so a configured quiet mode or update-check opt-in was silently lost on every wizard run, even though the prompt only controls the warning thresholds. Declining now removes only the six threshold keys, and the section is removed only when nothing else is left in it.
- `al sync` (and the sync before each launch command) now removes the Agent Layer chime Stop hook from `.claude/settings.json` when you disable both `agents.claude` and `agents.claude_vscode`. Previously the hook stayed, because sync writes `>` and `&` in the hook command as `\u003e` and `\u0026` and cleanup looked only for the unescaped text, so running `claude` directly kept chiming. Your other settings and hooks are unchanged.
- `al sync`, `al vscode`, and the sync before the other launch commands no longer delete VS Code settings that land inside the Agent Layer block in `.vscode/settings.json`. VS Code and extensions such as Peacock add a new setting after the last property in the file, which in a file created by `al sync` is inside the block, so the next sync silently removed it. Sync now moves every setting it does not own, with its comments, to just after the block, and fails instead of discarding block content it can't read as settings. Agent Layer still regenerates its own keys, `chat.tools.terminal.autoApprove`, `chat.agentSkillsLocations`, and `claudeCode.allowDangerouslySkipPermissions`, and still removes the retired `chat.tools.global.autoApprove`.
- `al skills push` now validates a skill it copies from the destination branch into `.agent-layer/skills-imported/` when nothing local needs pushing. Previously, if a reviewer left an invalid skill on the contribution branch, such as a `SKILL.md` without a `description`, push reported `unchanged` and `push succeeded`. It then wrote that skill locally, so `al sync` and every launch command failed until the file was fixed by hand. Push now reports that skill as failed with `would not be a valid skill`, leaves the local copy and its lock entry unchanged, and still updates the other skills in the group.
- `al wizard` now ends `.agent-layer/.env` with a newline when it adds a secret. Previously the file it wrote had no final newline, so a later `echo AL_X=... >> .agent-layer/.env` joined the new line onto the last secret: `${AL_X}` was reported missing and the earlier secret held the wrong value, with no error. The wizard also adds new secrets in a fixed, sorted order, so the `.env` diff it previews now matches the file it writes. A file written by an earlier version gains its missing final newline when the wizard adds a new secret or when you add the newline by hand. Replacing existing secrets alone preserves the file's final-newline state.
- `al skills pull` and `al skills push` now merge a file's content and executable bit separately, as Git does. Previously, if one side changed a file's executable bit and the other changed its content, for example upstream ran `chmod +x scripts/run.sh` while you edited that script, the skill failed with a `mode` conflict, or a `binary` conflict for a non-text file. That blocked the skill's other updates and sent you to a resolution workspace where Git had nothing to resolve. The merge now keeps both changes. A `mode` conflict is reported only when both sides add the same file with different executable bits.
- The managed `.gitignore` block no longer ignores a root `CLAUDE.md`. Agent Layer has written its Claude instructions to `.claude/CLAUDE.md` since v0.17.1, but the block kept ignoring the old root path, so a root `CLAUDE.md` you wrote yourself, for example with Claude Code's `/init`, was hidden from `git status`, skipped by `git add .`, and never reached your teammates. Run `al upgrade` (or `al upgrade repair-gitignore-block`) to update `.agent-layer/gitignore.block` and the root `.gitignore`; `al sync` alone keeps applying the existing block. Your choices to track `.agent-layer/` or `docs/agent-layer/` are kept. Sync still deletes a root `CLAUDE.md` that Agent Layer generated.
- `al upgrade plan` now lists, under "Files to review for removal", unknown files and directories under `.agent-layer/` and `docs/agent-layer/` that `al upgrade --apply-deletions` would delete, including your own skills and instruction files, at the paths where the upgrade's migrations will leave them. Previously the plan listed only template leftovers and could report nothing to remove while `--apply-deletions` then deleted those paths. `.agent-layer/tmp/` and kept paths are still excluded. To keep a local path, add it to `.agent-layer/upgrade-keep-list`; to recover a path an earlier upgrade deleted, run `al upgrade rollback <snapshot-id>`.
- `al sync`, the sync before each launch command, and `al dispatch` no longer fail when `.claude` or `.codex` is a symlink you manage and that client is turned off. Previously, with both `agents.claude` and `agents.claude_vscode` disabled, or with `agents.codex` and `agents.vscode` disabled, sync stopped with an error ending in `.claude must be a real file inside the repository while cleaning Agent Layer chime hooks` even when the linked folder had no Agent Layer chime hook to remove, although sync had written through the same link while the client was on. Sync now reads through the link and does nothing when there is no chime hook. A symlinked `.grok/hooks` folder without the Grok chime hook is likewise left alone. If the linked settings still contain the hook, sync fails with the same error rather than editing a file outside the repository; remove the hook from the linked file by hand, then run `al sync`.
- Codex dispatches survive transient stream retries such as `Reconnecting... 2/5 (request timed out)`. Previously Agent Layer treated every Codex `error` event as fatal and stopped a run that Codex would have recovered. Codex dispatches still fail on `turn.failed`, `turn.aborted`, a nonzero provider exit, or an exit without a completed turn; when no turn failure event reports a reason, the failure message includes the last Codex error.
- `al sync` and `al doctor` now warn about a literal secret in an MCP server URL whose host or userinfo is a `${AL_*}` placeholder, such as `https://${AL_MCP_HOST}/mcp?api_key=sk-live-123` or `https://user:token@${AL_HOST}/mcp`. Previously the critical `POLICY_SECRET_IN_URL` warning was skipped for any URL Go could not parse, which includes every URL with a placeholder host. A query value that mixes literal text with a placeholder, such as `token=abc${AL_X}`, now also counts as literal, matching skill import validation. Scheme-relative URLs such as `//user:secret@example.com/mcp` still warn about literal userinfo, and query-like text after `#` is ignored by the warning, skill import validation, and benchmark credential checks.
- `al skills add` and `al skills remove` now report only the skills that failed when they abort, and end with `al skills add failed` or `al skills remove failed`. Neither command changes anything when a skill fails, but previously the report also listed the other skills as `imported`, `retired`, or `unchanged` and ended with `partially succeeded`, then repeated the whole report as the error. For example, removing a `skills/*` selector while one skill had local edits reported the other skills as `retired`, yet they were still on disk. The error is now `no local state was changed because N skill(s) failed`.
- `al wizard --profile` without `--yes` now writes nothing in a repository where Agent Layer is not installed, as documented for preview mode. It previews the profile against an empty config and notes that `--yes` will install Agent Layer first. Previously it ran `al init` before reading the profile, so a preview, or even a missing or invalid profile path, left `.agent-layer/` and a root `.gitignore` behind. With or without `--yes`, the profile is now read and validated before anything is written.

## v0.23.1 - 2026-09-29

### Changed
- Configuration validation rejects enabled MCP servers that enter the generated root `.mcp.json` but exclude `vscode` whenever VS Code is enabled, including Claude-selected servers when Muse is disabled; previously this applied only while Muse and VS Code were both enabled, so VS Code loaded those servers. Affected configurations stop syncing until the server selects `vscode` or every enabled Muse, Claude, or Claude VS Code integration selecting it is disabled.

### Fixed
- Explicit client flags replace matching generated launch defaults instead of sending both, fixing Grok duplicate-model errors and applying the same precedence to Claude, Muse, Copilot, and Antigravity. Copilot’s repeatable MCP configuration and server-exclusion options remain additive, with identical generated entries omitted.
- `al copilot` now loads the generated `.copilot/mcp-config.json`, which Copilot CLI does not discover on its own, so Copilot sessions receive their configured MCP servers, including Agent Dispatch.
- Grok and `al copilot` no longer load root `.mcp.json` servers whose `clients` exclude them when Claude is enabled without Muse; previously these exclusions applied only while Muse was enabled.
- `make test` and `make coverage` fail when a package's test run starts but never reports a package-level result, which previously passed when a test binary was replaced or exited through a raw syscall.
- Make recipes run with `-euo pipefail` under macOS system Make (GNU Make 3.81), which ignores `.SHELLFLAGS`; previously `make test`, `make coverage`, `make ci`, and the `make test` pre-commit hook passed with failing tests there.

## v0.23.0 - 2026-09-26

### Added
- `al dispatch reserve` creates a named invocation without launching it. `al dispatch start --reservation <handle>` launches it once; repeated starts of a retained reservation error with guidance to inspect the invocation and continue only when available. Unknown, expired, already-started, and cancelled reservations fail with exit codes 80–83. Unstarted reservations expire after `dispatch.reservation_expiry_days` (default 7). After retention removes a reservation, its three-word handle may be reused. The commands are CLI only, not MCP tools.

### Changed
- `make test` and `make coverage` print per-package results, failures, skips, and errors instead of one line per test, and keep each run's complete `go test` events and printed output under `.agent-layer/tmp/test-logs/`.

### Fixed
- `al update` reports the installed global CLI version after updating, even when a repository pin would otherwise intercept `al --version`, and the completion message states that repository pins are unchanged.

## v0.22.0 - 2026-09-21

### Added
- Optional, default-disabled Muse Code integration: interactive launch, native model discovery, wizard and doctor support, and Agent Dispatch conversations with continuation and termination evidence.
- Shared private Claude/Muse MCP output with native client filtering, workspace-scoped owned command policy, and live MCP permission checks that preserve explicit user denies.
- Pinned native Muse loopback fixtures using synthetic credentials.

### Changed
- Grok model discovery treats an explicit unauthenticated diagnostic as an error, including when the CLI also emits fallback models.
- Configuration validation rejects shared MCP servers excluded from VS Code only when both Muse and VS Code are enabled.
- `al update` reports the CLI version before and after the update in its completion message.
- `al upgrade` prints the repository pin it starts from and the version it will upgrade to before applying changes.

### Fixed
- Codex and Muse preserve MCP dispatch depth, parent-run metadata, and development runtime selection; development MCP startup uses the invoking source binary even when PATH selects an older release.
- Source Make targets such as `make al-wizard` and `make al-sync` bypass repository release pins without relying on an inherited development environment.
- Grok dispatch removes staged prompts on success and failure, reports cleanup failures in terminal inspection, and retains completed answers if cleanup fails.
- Benchmark artifact sanitization fails closed when required credential files cannot be read.
- Restore Claude instructions at `.claude/CLAUDE.md` and remove only the generated obsolete rules copy, preserving handwritten files and symlinked rules directories.
- Benchmark artifact sanitization still redacts credentials from historical `.muse-config/muse/auth.json`.
- Muse command-policy retirement ignores a receipt that names another workspace, so a planted `.muse/agent-layer-policy.json` cannot delete that workspace's grants.

## v0.21.1 - 2026-09-18

### Changed
- Agent Dispatch conversation names keep the three-element `size-shape-electrical` form. Size stays at 37 tokens; the shape list includes colors and other non-size adjectives; the electrical list includes additional real parts.
- Inactive dispatch mappings and confirmed terminal evidence now expire after `dispatch.session_retention_days` (default 30) instead of a hard-coded 30 days.
- Name-pool exhaustion reports retained, active, and unreadable occupancy against pool capacity, and recommends shortening `dispatch.session_retention_days` only when retained names exist.
- Website homepage uses the Grok logo asset instead of a text placeholder.

### Fixed
- A failed dispatch name reservation no longer leaves a pending conversation mapping that retention would treat as active and never reclaim.
- A failed fresh dispatch reservation no longer leaves unpublished pending run evidence that retention would never prune.
- Website CI and release publishing validate local HTML asset references before publication.

## v0.21.0 - 2026-09-18

### Added
- DeltaSelect website pages and published research citation, with an interactive benchmark task selector and guidance for running studies.
- Optional benchmark guidance skill for selecting tasks, running studies, and investigating results.
- Agent-readable documentation discovery through `llms.txt` and Markdown mirrors.

### Changed
- Refreshed website guidance for Agent Dispatch, Git-backed skill imports, provider isolation, and benchmark workflows.
- Website CI validates the current staged documentation using a synthetic version retained by the publication policy.

## v0.20.0 - 2026-09-09

### Added
- Live harness model discovery for Claude, Codex, Grok, Antigravity, and GitHub Copilot CLI.
- Wizard prefetches model options across all supported harnesses at startup and falls back gracefully to defaults or custom input if discovery fails.
- GitHub Copilot CLI headless SDK model discovery and doctor model health checks.

### Changed
- Standardized Antigravity model parsing to native model IDs.
- Configuration validation allows dynamically discovered models across all supported agent harnesses while retaining custom model entry.

## v0.19.0 - 2026-09-07

### Added
- CLI commands `al dispatch inspect` and `al dispatch output` for observing running or terminal dispatches and reading final answers or captured events.
- MCP tools `dispatch_inspect` and `dispatch_output`.
- Dispatches support selector targeting by conversation `handle` or exact `invocation_id`, with bounded provider process-group termination confirmation.

### Changed
- Provider cancellation requests now verify process-group termination before considering work stopped.

## v0.18.6 - 2026-09-05

### Added
- HTTP MCP servers can declare client-managed OAuth authentication with `auth = "oauth"`; `al doctor` reports these servers without attempting unauthenticated tool discovery.

### Changed
- Agent Dispatch now preserves provider conversation identity across failed handoffs and continuations, records provider activity timestamps, and requires bounded proof of provider process-group termination before releasing ownership.
- Dispatched child processes suppress inherited update warnings so machine-oriented dispatch output stays focused on the requested work.

### Fixed
- MCP validation now rejects unsupported authentication values and safely removes HTTP-only authentication fields from stdio server configuration.

## v0.18.5 - 2026-09-02

### Changed
- Completed benchmark studies can regenerate reports from their immutable manifests without revalidating current project treatments or starting provider and verifier processes, and recovery-only runs print the regenerated report path.
- Upgrade commands reject targets newer than the running CLI and direct users to run the target release binary.

### Fixed
- Release artifact builds now require the target migration manifest and smoke-test upgrade planning and application with the built binary, preventing releases with incomplete embedded upgrade metadata.

## v0.18.4 - 2026-09-01

### Added
- DeepSWE planner export schema v3 pins per-task published sample size and variance so one-repetition studies can report labeled `published_proxy` inference when observed Welch variance is unavailable.

### Changed
- Study reports prefer observed Welch inference when every required task has at least two completed repetitions in both arms. Schema-v3 selections otherwise use shared published-proxy variance; schema-v2 selections without those pins remain unavailable at one repetition.
- Reports record inference source and published-variance provenance and surface selector versus executed model or reasoning mismatches.

## v0.18.3 - 2026-08-30

### Added
- `al dispatch start --role` and MCP `dispatch_start` `role` retain a caller-defined workflow role as dispatch evidence.
- `al benchmark run --recover-only` finalizes retained evidence-backed verifier test timeouts without starting a provider or verifier.

### Changed
- Official `al benchmark init` studies pin embedded benchmark-safe core rules and workflow skills, keep the project's instructions and skills as unreferenced audit snapshots, and require `plan-reviewer`, `implementer`, and `code-reviewer` dispatch roles.
- Benchmark progress reports configured timeout budgets, attempt limits, concurrent active cells, and each experiment's effective workflow.
- Paid Grok cells pause before inference when the repo-local OAuth credential has 30 minutes or less remaining.

### Fixed
- Evidence-backed verifier test timeouts become explicit zero-score `test_timeout` outcomes instead of remaining eligible for verifier replay.
- A cell failure stops assigning new paid work without cancelling sibling cells that are already running.

## v0.18.2 - 2026-08-29

### Added
- Paid benchmark cells now persist provider-completion checkpoints and support verifier-only replay from the exact retained provider patch without another provider call.

### Changed
- Benchmark progress now reports the active environment, provider, or verifier phase with elapsed time and its effective timeout.
- Benchmark cancellation gives Pier a bounded graceful-cleanup window before process-group escalation.

### Fixed
- Provider streams and patches survive verifier failures, cancellation, cleanup errors, and artifact-promotion failures; failed promotion retains and reports its staging path.
- Linux cleanup repairs verifier-owned logs for running and stopped containers before removal, including root ownership repair through a temporary container when needed.
- Failed verifier replays retain their checkpoint and staging evidence instead of becoming resumable paid failures, while sanitization preserves a byte-exact private replay patch.

## v0.18.1 - 2026-08-28

### Changed
- Benchmark runtime preflights now persist content-addressed receipts and reuse them on later identical invocations; `al benchmark run` and `al benchmark readiness` warn when DeepSWE `linux/amd64` task containers require host emulation.

### Fixed
- Retained Grok and Antigravity streams are now validated before paid provider calls, and failed stream-preflight artifacts are cleaned up.

## v0.18.0 - 2026-08-28

### Added
- Added `al update` to update the global CLI through its current installation method: Homebrew formula upgrades use Homebrew, while script installations preserve their existing prefix through the official installer.

### Changed
- Upgrade guidance now uses `al update` for the global CLI and keeps `al upgrade` as the separate repository migration workflow.

### Fixed
- MCP discovery now avoids duplicate built-in Agent Dispatch entries and does not pass version-dispatch state into built-in MCP child processes.
- Global CLI update detection now fails explicitly for development, dispatched, ambiguous, or nonstandard installations instead of risking an unsafe overwrite.

## v0.17.9 - 2026-08-28

### Changed
- Benchmark study preparation now preflights runtime per task and experiment and retains each task image across its serial cells before reclaiming it, with cleanup preserved after failed or cancelled runs.
- Benchmark overlay certification now derives identity from the pinned image and exact overlay source while still rebuilding and rechecking overlay images; Grok benchmark execution uses Pier's disposable-container `devbox` sandbox without a host Bubblewrap dependency.

### Fixed
- Benchmark run heartbeat output now resets on real progress and reports after 60 seconds of inactivity, avoiding misleading duplicate heartbeats.

## v0.17.8 - 2026-08-27

### Added
- `al benchmark init <selection.json>` now scaffolds a self-contained bare-versus-Agent-Layer study with a benchmark-safe provider configuration and snapshots of the current instructions and skills. Added `docs/BENCHMARK.md` with the recommended workflow and advanced controls.

### Changed
- Benchmark run and readiness commands now choose host-aware concurrency automatically, preflight Docker capacity before image pulls, reclaim task images by default, and report stage/task progress with long-running heartbeats. Readiness can target the tasks selected by a study.
- CI coverage is now behavioral rather than quota-based, and shell syntax validation is part of the complete CI gate; coverage remains available as diagnostic reporting.

### Fixed
- Antigravity structured terminal responses now retain the complete final answer even when it exceeds the structured metadata key limit.

## v0.17.7 - 2026-08-27

### Changed
- Agent Dispatch now uses structured provider output internally for every supported agent, including Antigravity display-name models, while returning only the extracted plain-text answer to callers.

### Fixed
- Antigravity exact-slug dispatches now allocate their structured event capture before provider execution instead of failing before launch.

## v0.17.6 - 2026-08-27

### Changed
- Release catalog certification now runs before tagging in eight isolated, bounded shards. Release publication reuses only a successful certification for the exact tag commit instead of repeating the full Docker audit.
- Benchmark readiness reports task-level progress and supports deterministic task filtering, sharding, and per-task timeouts.

### Fixed
- Empty MCP preflight contracts now encode `servers` as an array, preserving the benchmark study contract when no MCP servers are enabled.
- The `quill-shared-toolbar-focus` readiness image now installs pinned `xauth`, allowing the complete pinned DeepSWE catalog to certify successfully.

## v0.17.5 - 2026-08-27

### Fixed
- Empty MCP preflight contracts now encode `servers` as an array, preserving the benchmark study contract when no MCP servers are enabled.

## v0.17.4 - 2026-08-26

### Changed
- Release preflight now certifies the pinned DeepSWE benchmark catalog before building release artifacts, with bounded Docker image cleanup during the catalog audit.
- Hosted benchmark readiness now bootstraps a minimal Agent Layer workspace in the release checkout before certification.
- DeepSWE benchmark selections now translate published provider model identities to the exact canonical identities accepted by the benchmark CLI and report supported models when selectors are invalid.
- The `.agent-layer/.env` file is optional when no Agent Layer secrets are needed; unreadable or malformed files still fail explicitly.
- The `implement` skill now limits plan and code-review corrections to the requested input scope.

### Fixed
- Docker cleanup uses the correct force flag for containers, volumes, and task images.

## v0.17.3 - 2026-08-26

### Added
- `al benchmark run` supports pinned Antigravity 1.1.21 and Grok 1.0.5 coordinators, provider-native Agent Layer treatments, structured coordinator/dispatch evidence, and usage-based API-equivalent cost accounting without running a full benchmark during development.
- Antigravity and Grok benchmark adapters use the same repo-local subscription OAuth boundaries as their Agent Layer clients. Antigravity prefers its repo-local OAuth fallback and otherwise exports only the native keyring OAuth profile into the contained CLI fallback file; Grok stages only `.grok-config/auth.json`.

### Changed
- Agent Dispatch's tested Antigravity baseline is now 1.1.21 because benchmark child usage requires that release's structured headless output. Older Antigravity releases fail the existing provider-version preflight instead of running under an unevidenced stream contract.

## v0.17.2 - 2026-08-25

### Added
- Added `review/oversized` for otherwise-cleared entries over 100 files or 250 MiB (including oversized immediate children and top-level files), and `review/symlinks` for top-level or move-breaking links.
- Interactive upgrades can record intentional unknown files and directories from `.agent-layer/` and `docs/agent-layer/` in a gitignored `.agent-layer/upgrade-keep-list`. Kept paths are omitted from future upgrade plans and deletion flows.

### Changed
- `al wizard` replaces the workflow-bundle yes/no with an instruction choice (None, Rules, or Rules and memory) and a single skills catalog. Agent Layer development skills (`/implement`, `/ship-pr`, and the rest of that set) are one catalog row; selecting it installs those skills, and deselecting it removes them. Instructions and skills are independent.
- Consolidated the hidden `al organize-scratch` safety model around one complete metadata/hazard walk and outcome pipeline. Dry runs are now strictly read-only and print the full proposed review list; apply preserves unresolved prior review entries and records actual moved, collision, failed, and unattempted outcomes. Directory/file size limits, credential-bearing content, authored assets, nested checkout markers, unreadable paths, and move-breaking symlinks now conservatively force review.
- `al organize-scratch` now accepts non-repository and untracked/non-ignored roots but always refuses repository roots, including empty or unborn repositories, as well as subtrees containing tracked content. Git fact failures fail closed under stable English diagnostics. Registered entry, nested, foreign main, and foreign linked worktrees are all protected and repaired from the correct repository context, including newline-containing paths and external linked registrations owned by a moved main checkout, with failed or stale repairs returning non-zero. Invalid `--keep` paths now fail explicitly instead of being ignored.
- `make dev` is now a fast formatting and lint loop (`make fmt` then `make lint`) instead of chaining coverage and release tests. `make ci` remains the complete pre-PR verification gate.
- Public website pages and best-practice guides were rewritten for clearer, more direct language.

### Fixed
- Listing `.agent-layer/tmp` in `.agent-layer/upgrade-keep-list` now keeps that directory and skips the grouped tmp deletion prompt. Individual files under tmp remain ineligible for the keep list. The interactive keep-list checklist includes `.agent-layer/tmp` last, unchecked.
- Codex project trust is now seeded using the physical repository path after symlink resolution, so a repo opened through a symlink matches the managed `[projects."<root>"]` trust key. Trust-root resolution fails explicitly when the path cannot be canonicalized.
- Nested upgrade keep-list file entries no longer treat ancestor directories as fully kept, so sibling unknown paths remain eligible for deletion.
- Upgrades now preserve the `.agent-layer/` and `docs/agent-layer/` git tracking choices stored in `.agent-layer/gitignore.block` while still applying new managed ignore rules from the release template. Match, `al upgrade plan`, and overwrite preview compare against that merged target, so customized tracking alone is not reported as an update. A `#` after a managed tracking pattern is rejected as unsupported, because Git treats that text as part of the pattern rather than a comment.
- Locked source loading removes empty immediate child directories under `.agent-layer/skills/` before validation, so sync, launch, dispatch, and skill-import share the same cleanup. Nonempty or malformed skill directories still fail strictly.

## v0.17.1 - 2026-08-21

### Added
- `al skills diff <name>` compares live `base`, `local`, `upstream`, and `destination` trees as an ordinary Git unified diff.
- Pull and push merge conflicts now leave a Git workspace under `.agent-layer/tmp/skill-conflicts/<name>/`. Finish the merge with ordinary git commands and `al skills resolve <name>`.
- `ship-pr` includes a stateless `read-pr-comments.sh` command that prints every PR comment kind, including review-thread resolved/outdated state, as readable Markdown.

### Changed
- The Claude instruction shim is now `.claude/CLAUDE.md` instead of root `CLAUDE.md`. When Grok is enabled, sync sets `[compat.claude] agents = false` in repo-local `.grok-config/config.toml`, and Grok launch/dispatch/VS Code set `GROK_CLAUDE_AGENTS_ENABLED=false`, so Grok does not load both generated instruction files. The `0.17.1` migration deletes Agent Layer-generated root `CLAUDE.md` files; hand-authored files at that path are left untouched.
- Recreating a deleted contribution branch reuses its prior publication checkpoint when that commit remains in the destination's history, avoiding conflicts with changes already merged from the earlier branch.

## v0.17.0 - 2026-08-20

### Added
- Grok Build CLI is a first-class Agent Layer client: `al grok`, `[agents.grok]` (`enabled`, `model`, `reasoning_effort`, `disable_memory`), always-on `GROK_HOME=<repo>/.grok-config`, native `.grok/config.toml` MCP and `[permission]` projection, seeded folder trust, `--sandbox` mapping, shared `.agents/skills/` skills, doctor warning for a missing or older-than-1.0.5 `grok`, `al probe grok`, wizard coverage, Agent Dispatch target `grok`, and `notifications.chime` via `.grok/hooks/agent-layer-chime.json`. Upgrade `0.17.0` defaults `agents.grok.enabled` to `false`.

### Fixed
- Grok sync now recognizes generated `.grok/config.toml` files by a stable marker across header revisions, requires the credential-bearing `.grok-config` home to be a real directory, and rejects symlinks before seeding repo trust outside the isolated home. Sync, `al grok`, Grok dispatch, and `al vscode` create that home at `0700` and tighten an existing real home the Grok CLI created at `0755`, instead of failing with a `chmod 700` instruction. Grok dispatch and capability probes also bound retained provider output with accurate truncation notices.

## v0.16.3 - 2026-08-09

### Added
- Added one content-addressed DeepSWE study workflow: `al benchmark run <study.toml>` executes explicit experiments from a website selection, resumes immutable cell evidence, and produces JSON and HTML reports with fixed-selection Welch comparisons and Holm-adjusted p-values. `al benchmark readiness` remains the developer preflight for the pinned task catalog.

### Changed
- Removed the obsolete `benchmark baseline`, `benchmark treatment`, `benchmark report`, matrix runner, and `benchmark correct-scores` implementations. Compatible historical selection evidence is read narrowly by the study reporter and corrected automatically from preserved verifier artifacts; private campaign state is never scanned or rewritten.

### Fixed
- The built-in Agent Dispatch MCP server now starts from the repository root embedded during `al sync`, so installing a newer global `al` no longer causes MCP clients with an older repo pin to bypass that pin. The launcher keeps the legacy `al dispatch mcp-server` argument contract when it reaches the cached binary, preserving compatibility with older pinned releases, and retains a same-project caller working directory for dispatched agents. Existing generated MCP files need a one-time refresh with the fixed binary (`AL_VERSION=v0.16.3 al sync`); this does not change the repo pin.

## v0.16.2 - 2026-08-08

### Added
- Added `al benchmark correct-scores` to regenerate versioned canonical results for affected stored DeepSWE runs from preserved verifier evidence. Benchmark reports consume the canonical result and fail rather than emit a known-incorrect score when neither it nor the required verifier artifacts remains available.

### Changed
- The generated `.agent-layer/.gitignore` no longer ignores `skills-imported/` or `skills.lock.json`. In a project that commits `.agent-layer/`, imported skills and their lockfile are now tracked, so a fresh clone or CI run has the exact imported skill content — including local edits — without a network `al skills pull`, and a `pinned` import reproduces without one. The two must be committed together: the imported tier is fully managed, and `al sync` rejects a skill directory that has no `skills.lock.json` entry. `.agent-layer/skills-imported/.staging/`, the import transaction's scratch space, stays ignored. `.agent-layer/.gitignore` is agent-owned and rewritten on every `al init`/`al upgrade`, so existing projects pick this up with no migration; run `git add .agent-layer/skills-imported .agent-layer/skills.lock.json` once after upgrading to start tracking them. Note that the root `.gitignore` block still ships `/.agent-layer/` uncommented, which ignores the whole directory and overrides this; projects that want their Agent Layer configuration in version control comment that line out in `.agent-layer/gitignore.block`.

### Fixed
- Repeated `al skills push` calls to a contribution branch now record the last successfully published tree separately from the source lock, so review-driven edits and explicit reversions add commits to the same pull-request branch without conflicting with or silently preserving the previous push. Compatible edits made directly on the destination branch are still retained. This release reads existing skill lock schema version 1 files and writes version 2 whenever it next changes a lock; every consumer of a committed version 2 lock must upgrade, while older Agent Layer binaries reject it with an explicit unsupported-version error instead of misreading new fields.

## v0.16.1 - 2026-08-06

### Fixed
- `al init` and `al upgrade` no longer block when `.agents/skills/` or `.claude/skills/` contains content that cannot be matched to a canonical Agent Layer skill. Those client roots are exclusively owned disposable projections, so inspecting their contents before replacing them contradicted the documented sync contract and prevented some v0.15.0 projects from upgrading to v0.16.0.

## v0.16.0 - 2026-08-06

Git-backed Agent Skill imports and a consolidated skill and instruction bundle.

### Added
- Git-backed Agent Skill imports. `al skills add <repository> <selector>...` records an import in a new `[[skills.imports]]` config block, `al skills pull` fetches every configured source and reconciles it with local content, `al skills status` reports local state without touching the network, `al skills reset <name>` discards one skill's local edits, `al skills remove` drops a selector, and `al skills push` publishes local changes back to a configured destination. Imported skills live in `.agent-layer/skills-imported/<skill-name>/` and stay editable; `pull` merges upstream changes without discarding local edits. Each import block carries its own `ref`, `tracking` (`tracked` or `pinned`), and `write_policy` (`none`, `branch`, or `direct`); `write_policy = "branch"` requires an explicit non-primary `push_branch`, and `al skills push` refuses to write to the destination's actual default branch. `add`, `remove`, `reset`, and `push` prompt before persistent configuration changes, destructive reset, or remote publication; non-interactive callers confirm with `--yes`. The generated `.agent-layer/.gitignore` ignores both `skills-imported/` and the `skills.lock.json` state file.
- A bundled `skill-sync` catalog skill for managing those imports from an agent. Its pre-approved shell surface is limited to `al skills` and `al sync`.
- `al organize-scratch --root <dir>` sorts a scratch directory into `reports/`, `artifacts/`, and `review/` folders and writes an `ORGANIZE-REVIEW.md` listing everything that still needs a human decision. It only moves entries: nothing is deleted, overwritten, or merged, and an entry whose destination is already taken is left in place. Defaults to a dry run; pass `--apply` to move. Registered Git worktrees are left alone unless `--move-worktrees` is given, in which case their registrations are repaired after the move. The command is a maintenance aid and is hidden from `al --help`.

### Changed
- Skill sources now use one strict, byte-exact tree contract. User-managed and Git-imported skills both require uppercase `SKILL.md`, reject symlinks and other non-regular nodes, preserve unknown/provider-specific frontmatter and every resource byte, and project from one locked immutable snapshot. Agent Layer now owns `.agents/skills/` and `.claude/skills/` completely: enabled roots are replaced wholesale and disabled roots are removed. The `v0.16.0` migration blocks before mutation if a pre-existing client root contains an entry that is neither marker-bearing output from a released Agent Layer version nor a directory matching a source-tier skill directory with a canonical regular `SKILL.md`.
- The workflow skill templates are consolidated. `implement` replaces the `plan-work`, `review-plan`, `implement-plan`, `fully-implement-plan`, and `full-workflow` chain, and `ship-pr` absorbs `address-pr-comments` and `fix-ci` as references. `boost-coverage`, `clean-and-fix-code`, `improve-codebase`, `review-uncommitted-code`, `run-and-fix-all-checks`, `schedule-backlog`, `simplify-codebase`, and `verify-work` are removed; their work is covered by the remaining skills. Existing installs keep their copies of the removed skills until they are deleted by hand; `al upgrade` reports them as orphans rather than removing them.
- `debug-and-fix-issue` is removed. No remaining skill covers reproduce-then-diagnose debugging; run those investigations directly, or hand the diagnosis to `implement` once the cause is known.
- `docs/agent-layer/ROADMAP.md` is no longer a memory file. The template is removed and the memory instructions, `audit-memory`, `audit-documentation`, and the `implement-backlog` loop mode no longer reference it; `BACKLOG.md` is now the only scheduling surface. An existing `ROADMAP.md` is left untouched on upgrade and simply becomes an ordinary project document. `al upgrade` still understands the `memory_roadmap_v1` ownership policy recorded in manifests from earlier releases, so upgrading a repo that has one continues to work.
- The `agent-dispatch` catalog skill is renamed to `dispatch-agent`, so agents now invoke it as `/dispatch-agent` and the `implement`, `ship-pr`, and `auto-skill-loop` skills instruct that name. The `v0.16.0` migration renames an installed `.agent-layer/skills/agent-dispatch/` directory to `.agent-layer/skills/dispatch-agent/` and fails if a populated destination already exists. The Agent Dispatch feature, its `al dispatch` commands, and the built-in `agent-layer` MCP tool names are unchanged.
- The managed instruction templates and the `dispatch-agent`, `audit-documentation`, `audit-memory`, `audit-tests`, `auto-skill-loop`, and `interface-audit` skills are rewritten for brevity. The `Explicit-only.` description marker is dropped in favor of per-client invocation metadata.
- The bundled instruction set is consolidated from five files to two: `00_rules.md` absorbs `01_base.md` and `03_tools.md`, and `02_memory.md` becomes `01_memory.md`. The user-managed `04_conventions.md` template is removed along with the user-owned instruction ownership rules; a project tailors instructions by editing the managed files or adding its own. The `v0.16.0` migration renames `02_memory.md` so its content carries forward. Existing `01_base.md`, `03_tools.md`, and `04_conventions.md` files are left on disk — instruction fragments are user-editable and may hold project-specific rules — and `al upgrade` reports them as orphans rather than removing them. Delete them by hand once you have moved anything you want to keep into `00_rules.md`.

### Fixed
- `al dispatch` now delivers `approvals.mode` to headless agents, which previously could not edit files in any mode except `yolo`. `codex exec` starts in a read-only sandbox and `claude -p` denies Edit/Write, so a dispatched agent approved to run commands failed on its first write. Dispatch now sends `sandbox_mode` to Codex (`read-only` for `none`/`mcp`, `workspace-write` for `commands`/`all`) and `--permission-mode` to Claude (`dontAsk` / `acceptEdits`). Editing follows command approval because Codex has no separate edit-approval rule: its sandbox is the edit gate. `yolo` is unchanged. Explicit `agents.codex.agent_specific.sandbox_mode` and `agents.claude.agent_specific.permissions.defaultMode` still win. Note that `workspace-write` keeps `.git` read-only and denies network access including loopback, so dispatched agents cannot commit or bind test servers without explicit `agent_specific` passthrough.
- Claude dispatches now pass the allowlisted commands and MCP servers as `--allowedTools`. Claude applies a project's `permissions.allow` rules only after its workspace trust dialog is accepted, and that dialog never appears under `-p`, so the generated settings file left every approval inert unless the repository happened to have been trusted in an earlier interactive session.
- A dispatched Claude agent that is denied a tool call now fails the dispatch instead of reporting success. Claude returns exit 0, `is_error: false`, and a fluent final answer for a run whose writes were all denied, so a denied dispatch previously looked complete.
- Git subprocesses now resolve the repository from the path they are given instead of honoring an inherited `GIT_DIR`. Git exports its repository-discovery variables to every hook, and they take precedence over `git -C <path>`, so benchmark provenance and pinned-checkout validation could report on a different repository than the one being measured when a run started from a Git hook.

### Internal
- Added the `v0.16.0` migration and template ownership manifests. The migration claims the client skill projection roots, renames the managed `02_memory.md` instruction file to `01_memory.md`, and renames the `agent-dispatch` catalog skill directory to `dispatch-agent`.
- The generated Homebrew formula no longer sets a redundant `version` field; Homebrew derives it from the release asset URLs.

## v0.15.0 - 2026-07-31

Agent Dispatch MCP and benchmark tooling release.

### Added
- Agent Dispatch now exposes a built-in `agent-layer` MCP server with
  `dispatch_options`, `dispatch_start`, `dispatch_wait`, `dispatch_continue`,
  and `dispatch_cancel`, using the same asynchronous handles, states, and
  durable result files as the CLI. The server is projected into enabled
  Codex, Claude, Antigravity, VS Code, and Copilot CLI clients.
- Added `al benchmark baseline`, `al benchmark treatment`, and
  `al benchmark report` for website-planned DeepSWE comparisons backed by
  immutable campaign evidence.

### Changed
- The bundled Agent Dispatch skill now uses the built-in MCP tools for
  bounded leaf work, while the CLI remains the human and scripting surface.
- Workflow skills were simplified around explicit root-to-leaf boundaries,
  review gates, and delegated delivery.
- Renamed the bundled `playwright-cli` skill to `playwright` while preserving
  the Playwright CLI command surface.

### Internal
- Added the `v0.15.0` migration and template ownership manifests. The
  migration renames the managed `playwright-cli` skill directory.

## v0.14.0 - 2026-07-22

Breaking Agent Dispatch lifecycle release. Dispatch now exposes asynchronous,
handle-based conversations with durable result files instead of synchronous
named conversations and fanout operations.

### Added
- `al dispatch start`, `wait`, `continue`, and `cancel`. `start` and
  `continue` return a handle immediately; `wait` blocks for the terminal state
  and returns the completed invocation's durable Markdown `result_path`.
- A stable JSON contract for every successful dispatch command. Independent
  `start` calls provide parallel work without a public fanout resource.

### Changed
- **Breaking:** `al dispatch` now requires the explicit lifecycle commands
  above. The synchronous fresh/resume syntax and `fanout`, `inspect`,
  `history`, `list`, and `delete` commands are removed.
- **Breaking:** per-agent `agents.<agent>.dispatch.default_agent` tables are
  removed. `start` requires `--agent`; the release migration deletes retired
  tables before strict config decoding.
- Completed results are persisted atomically before their invocation becomes
  `completed`; failed and cancelled conversations may be continued with the
  same handle.

### Fixed
- Dispatch and client launchers preserve cancellation signals, and sync ignores
  its transient lock file.
- Updated `golang.org/x/text` to v0.39.0 to remediate GO-2026-5970, which the
  release binary vulnerability scan detected in v0.38.0.

### Internal
- Added the v0.14.0 migration and template ownership manifests. The migration
  supports the established 0.10.2+ upgrade range and deletes retired per-agent
  dispatch default tables.

## v0.13.0 - 2026-07-17

Breaking Agent Dispatch redesign and workflow-skill refresh. Dispatch now
starts fresh, final-answer-only provider turns by default, and exposes explicit
continuation, inspection, history, cancellation, and fanout operations rather
than streaming provider traffic.

### Added
- `al dispatch resume <name>`, `fanout`, `inspect`, `history`, `cancel`,
  `list`, and `delete`. Named conversations have atomic mappings and immutable
  run-UUID records; fanout runs one shared prompt across independently retained
  targets.
- Separate fresh, resume, and inspection capability facts in `al dispatch
  options --json`, including installed provider versions and compatibility
  warnings. Claude Code 2.1.207, Codex CLI 0.144.1, and Antigravity 1.1.1 are
  the tested baselines; newer versions remain available with a warning, while
  older, unreadable, and malformed versions fail before launch.
- Private bounded run evidence, 30-day retention for eligible evidence and
  mappings, process-group supervision, final-answer replay, a safe pre-start
  retry, and Antigravity’s isolated documented log-file ID extractor with
  fail-loud `not resumable` handling.
- `al hook chime`, a project-shareable completion handler for Claude, Codex,
  and Antigravity. It filters non-terminal lifecycle events, fails open, uses
  the macOS system sound or Linux `canberra-gtk-play` when available, and never
  claims that a provider stop event proves task completion.

### Changed
- **Breaking:** `al dispatch` no longer streams answer text, progress, raw
  events, or provider diagnostics. Standard output contains only a successful
  final answer; standard error begins with one compact identity line.
- **Breaking:** the v1 `dispatch_capable` and streaming options fields were
  removed from the public JSON contract. Use separate capability facts instead.
- The default `dispatch.max_depth` is now `3`, allowing two nested dispatches
  after the initial call. Built-in workflows remain root-to-leaf and use
  external dispatch only for bounded leaf judgment.
- Antigravity's generated settings file is now shared state: Agent Layer
  patches only its managed model, permissions, and passthrough paths while
  preserving native workspace, approval, and trust settings.
- Codex VS Code launches now configure only extension-relevant runtime
  features; ordinary Codex CLI settings and status-line configuration are not
  projected into the VS Code path.
- Model suggestions were refreshed for Claude, Codex, Copilot CLI, and
  Antigravity in the wizard and dispatch option catalog.
- Version-binary handoff moved from `internal/dispatch` to
  `internal/versiondispatch` to distinguish it from Agent Dispatch.
- `auto-skill-loop` now provides `fix-issue-log`, `implement-backlog`,
  `improve-interfaces`, and `improve-codebase` modes plus repository-added mode
  files. It selects adaptive fresh work, preserves local blockers,
  batches and ships centrally, keeps `/ship-pr` isolated in its shipper
  dispatch, independently gates exact-head merge authorization, and reconciles
  each result without preplanning the full source.
- Instruction-only assets now live under their owning skills' `references/`
  directories; output and machine-readable resources remain under `assets/`.
- Bundled workflow skills are now more explicitly root-to-leaf: orchestration
  owns transitions and delivery, while Agent Dispatch is restricted to named,
  bounded leaf roles. The refresh adds `clean-and-fix-code`,
  `debug-and-fix-issue`, `fully-implement-plan`, `review-uncommitted-code`,
  `run-and-fix-all-checks`, and `verify-work` as the current workflow surface.

### Removed
- Retired the standalone `fix-issues` skill after preserving its explicit
  filters, batching, dispositions, and one-delivery behavior in the
  `fix-issue-log` mode.
- Retired superseded workflow skill names and wrappers, including
  `audit-and-fix-uncommitted-changes`, `debug-issue`, `review-scope`,
  `verify-against-plan`, `prune-new-tests`, `simplify-new-code`,
  `complete-current-phase`, `finish-task`, `repair-checks`, and
  `multi-agent-plan-review`. The migration manifest renames managed skill
  directories where a direct replacement exists; retirement remains
  ownership-aware and reviewable during upgrade.

### Fixed
- Dispatch now waits for provider completion evidence and terminates failed
  process groups, preventing terminal failure while owned descendants continue.
- Projection preparation is serialized before provider launch, avoiding
  concurrent generated-skill writes while allowing independent targets to run
  concurrently afterward.
- Dispatch now preserves the caller's working directory across linked
  worktrees, records resolved targets for reliable resume, validates provider
  diagnostics, and closes cancellation and recovery races without releasing a
  live process claim prematurely.
- `al sync`, launchers, and the root command preserve cancellation signals and
  logical repository roots more reliably. Upgrade rollback retries now reset
  scoped targets before restoring a failed snapshot, allowing a partial
  rollback to converge safely.

### Internal
- Added the v0.13.0 migration and template ownership manifests. The migration
  supports upgrades from the 0.10.2 line and renames managed workflow skill
  directories and their instruction resources.
- Updated the Go toolchain to 1.26.5, modernized terminal UI dependencies, and
  added release-binary vulnerability scanning.

## v0.12.3 - 2026-07-10

Patch release for the v0.12 line. Adds current Codex model and reasoning-effort suggestions, and fixes `al sync` so generated skill resources stay reconciled safely with their source trees.

### Changed
- Codex model suggestions now include `gpt-5.6-sol`, `gpt-5.6-terra`, and `gpt-5.6-luna` in the wizard and Agent Dispatch options.
- Codex reasoning-effort suggestions now include `max` and `ultra` in the wizard and Agent Dispatch options.

### Fixed
- `al sync` now reconciles generated skill resources (`scripts/`, `references/`, and `assets/`) with their source skill directory: it removes stale resources and handles file/directory transitions without replacing the generated `SKILL.md`.
- Skill-resource sync now detects source symlinks without following them and safely replaces generated destination symlinks rather than writing through them.

### Internal
- Added v0.12.3 migration and template ownership manifests. The migration has no operations; existing configurations need no manual migration.

## v0.12.2 - 2026-07-06

Patch release for the v0.12 line. Tightens bundled skill and instruction contracts, fixes installer prompt routing edge cases, adds public skill-architecture documentation, and hardens the release workflow before signing.

### Added
- Added the Agent Layer-specific Skills approach documentation page, including the target root-skill model, workflow-skill boundaries, and the mapping from target modules to current bundled skills.
- Added template tests covering bundled skill and instruction contract expectations so future wording changes are checked automatically.

### Changed
- Bundled skill templates now state scope, deferral, review, and orchestration rules more precisely across planning, review, issue fixing, PR handling, verification, and autonomous-loop workflows.
- Multi-agent plan review instructions now make reviewer orchestration and synthesis responsibilities clearer, while participant terminology is standardized across skill and instruction docs.
- The Agent Dispatch catalog skill now activates only for explicit external dispatch targets or skill-directed dispatch, leaving generic subagent work to built-in subagent behavior.
- Universal skill, CLI-skill, and instruction design guides were generalized for portable authoring guidance and now separate client/specification requirements from Agent Layer-specific conventions.
- Release preflight documentation now reflects that CI, release-script checks, and upgrade-doc validation run before tagging.
- The release workflow now runs `make ci` before importing signing credentials.

### Fixed
- Installer and upgrade prompt routing now flow through a shared prompt router, preserving required overwrite/delete prompt validation while centralizing optional prompt fallbacks.
- Statusline source replacement prompting is now gated on the actual optional prompt capability, preventing zero-value prompt implementations from being treated as wired callbacks.
- Zero-value prompt fallback behavior is covered for unified overwrite, grouped tmp deletion, statusline source, config defaults, and skills migration prompts.
- Agent Dispatch now forwards SIGINT and SIGTERM to the full dispatched process group, so shell-launched child processes terminate promptly on interruption.
- End-to-end assertions were updated for the retired generated Codex `.codex/AGENTS.md` shim.

### Internal
- Added v0.12.2 migration and template ownership manifests. The migration has no operations; the release updates managed templates and docs only.

## v0.12.1 - 2026-07-04

Patch release for the v0.12 line. Fixes binary Homebrew publishing, preserves Codex hook trust state across chime refreshes, and retires the generated `.codex/AGENTS.md` shim that duplicated root `AGENTS.md` when Codex used repo-local config.

### Changed
- `al sync` no longer writes `.codex/AGENTS.md`. Codex reads root `AGENTS.md` as project instructions, and repo-local `CODEX_HOME` caused `.codex/AGENTS.md` to be loaded as home-level instructions as well.
- Workflow instruction and skill templates were tightened for tradeoff handling, full-workflow spec approval, and prune-new-tests reviewer output.
- Release documentation now clarifies binary Homebrew tap PR handling.

### Fixed
- Codex chime refresh now preserves existing hook trust state stored inside the managed chime markers and remains idempotent across repeated syncs.
- Homebrew formula generation now includes both macOS ARM64 and macOS Intel release assets.
- Homebrew binary formula installs now mark `al` executable before generating shell completions.
- The release workflow now verifies all binary assets needed by the Homebrew tap, including `al-darwin-amd64`.

### Internal
- Added v0.12.1 migration and template ownership manifests. The migration deletes only Agent Layer-generated `.codex/AGENTS.md` files; hand-authored files at that path are left untouched.

## v0.12.0 - 2026-07-03

Consolidates all unreleased work since `v0.11.0` into one coherent release. Adds typed Antigravity model selection, configurable Agent Dispatch depth, repo-local Codex home opt-in, shared Codex TOML patching, provider turn-stop chimes, serialized sync writes, new workflow skills, signed/notarized macOS binaries, and binary Homebrew delivery.

### Added
- Antigravity model selection is now a first-class Agent Layer setting. `agents.antigravity.model` is projected into generated Antigravity settings, `al wizard` can discover choices from live `agy models` output with catalog fallback, and `al dispatch --model` plus `al dispatch options` now report and accept Antigravity model overrides. Antigravity reasoning level remains encoded in the selected model display string; `--reasoning-effort` is still unsupported for Antigravity.
- `dispatch.max_depth` allows nested `al dispatch` chains beyond the default depth of `1`. `AL_DISPATCH_ACTIVE` now carries the current dispatch depth, invalid or empty values fail loudly, and config validation rejects non-positive depths.
- `agents.codex.local_config_dir` controls whether Agent Layer sets `CODEX_HOME=<repo>/.codex` for `al codex`, Codex dispatch, and `al vscode`. The default is `false`, preserving Codex's normal global/project config layering; set it to `true` to keep repo-local Codex auth, sessions, logs, and runtime state.
- `notifications.chime` is a global opt-in for provider turn-stop chimes. Sync projects provider-native stop hooks for Claude and Codex and an Agent Layer-owned Antigravity plugin, while preserving user-owned hooks and plugin content.
- `al sync` now serializes concurrent writes for the same project with a repo-local lock, preventing overlapping generated-file updates during parallel launches or dispatches.
- `.codex/config.toml` is now treated as shared state. Agent Layer patches only managed Codex keys, MCP projection, project trust, feature toggles, and statusline entries while preserving unrelated user or Codex runtime TOML, comments, multiline strings, and plugin settings.
- `al wizard` adds a Git tracking step for `.agent-layer/` and `docs/agent-layer/`, implemented by rewriting the managed `.agent-layer/gitignore.block` source before sync.
- New built-in workflow skills: `auto-skill-loop`, `full-workflow`, `interface-audit`, and `multi-agent-plan-review`. `ship-pr` also gained a bundled `monitor-pr.sh` helper for polling pull request readiness and filtering review-bot noise.
- Release builds now sign Darwin binaries with Developer ID, enable hardened runtime, notarize them with Apple, and write checksums after signing. The release workflow also documents the required signing and notarization secrets.
- Homebrew delivery now uses prebuilt macOS and Linux release binaries with per-platform checksums instead of building from the source tarball.
- Shared provider option catalogs now back wizard and dispatch option suggestions for supported agents, with corrected Codex model/reasoning suggestions and `fable` in the Claude model catalog.

### Changed
- `al claude`, `al codex`, `al copilot`, and `al agy` now replace the `al` process with the target agent CLI instead of spawning a child process. Agent exit codes now pass through directly and the old `Error: <agent> exited with error: ...` wrapper line is gone.
- macOS permission prompts are now attributed to the actual signed Agent Layer binary that launches the agent. Users may see one prompt per agent after upgrading; old `al` entries in Privacy & Security are cosmetic.
- `approvals.mode = "yolo"` no longer emits the VS Code `chat.tools.global.autoApprove` setting. YOLO still sends full-auto controls to Claude, Codex, Copilot CLI, and Antigravity.
- `al wizard` no longer offers a workflow-bundle refresh when Agent Layer workflow files already exist. The workflow-bundle prompt is install-only for missing bundle files and preserves existing files; use `al upgrade` for managed workflow updates.
- Agent-specific passthrough config now uses the shared `ProviderPassthrough` type, and Agent Layer-owned Antigravity model config is rejected under `agents.antigravity.agent_specific.model`.
- The Claude status line now rounds weekly-limit reset time up to the next whole day/hour so a partial remaining unit stays visible, drops the `#` prefix on the session id, and avoids per-untracked-file `git diff --no-index` processes when counting untracked line changes.
- Agent Dispatch target metadata now uses the shared provider option catalog, reports Antigravity model override support, preserves inherited `CODEX_HOME` unless Codex local config is enabled, and wraps stdout write failures with target-specific dispatch exit errors.
- Release tooling now verifies published binary assets before opening the Homebrew tap PR and renders the full binary formula from release checksums.
- CI/local workflow documentation now notes that `make ci` includes `make test-race`, and release docs clarify that tagged migration and ownership manifests are immutable release artifacts.

### Fixed
- Upgrades move `agents.antigravity.agent_specific.model` to `agents.antigravity.model` before strict runtime validation rejects the passthrough key.
- Wizard Git tracking recognizes managed patterns with inline comments and avoids duplicating them.
- Antigravity wizard model options are prefetched before prompting, so the wizard can show live model choices rather than a stale or empty catalog.
- Codex reasoning suggestions and restored shared agent option suggestions now stay valid across CLI, wizard, and dispatch surfaces.
- Codex TOML patching now preserves multiline strings, plugin defaults, inline comments on managed keys, and unrelated shared config while updating Agent Layer-owned entries.
- Strict config validation now fails loudly on malformed nested `AskUserQuestion` overrides and invalid `AL_DISPATCH_ACTIVE` depth values.
- Gitignore management was hardened to prevent managed block data loss and handle inline-comment tracking defaults correctly.
- `al doctor` diagnostics and CI dead-code enforcement were corrected, including loader-error handling that previously weakened the dead-code gate.
- The hidden deprecated `al mcp-prompts` path is now a no-op stub instead of a live prompt delivery surface.
- Release and formula update tests now cover signed binary build outputs, checksum extraction, notarization hooks, and binary Homebrew formula rendering.

### Security
- The Go toolchain/dependency floor was updated to address reachable Go standard-library vulnerabilities found by local vulnerability analysis.
- Codex trust-block generation now rejects invalid UTF-8 repository roots before writing project trust entries.
- The release workflow now checks out code with persisted credentials disabled in the release build job.

### Documentation
- README, site docs, troubleshooting, concepts, reference, FAQ, and security pages were refreshed for current Antigravity, MCP, Codex, upgrade, and release behavior.
- `docs/RELEASE.md` now documents Developer ID signing, notarization, binary Homebrew delivery, release asset verification, and the complete set of required release secrets.
- Agent instruction templates were tightened: production code should validate inputs and returned errors defensively, repeated failed fixes should trigger research before another attempt, and memory files are described as living records of the current working tree.
- Skill design and CLI skill design docs were tightened, and generated workflow skills now include clearer subagent/review constraints.

### Internal
- Shared semver parsing/comparison moved into `internal/version`, and release message helpers were consolidated.
- A reusable TOML patching engine (`internal/tomlpatch`) now powers safer shared-config edits.
- Upgrade migration logic was split to keep skill migration code separate from the main migration coordinator.
- Markdown heading slug generation now avoids quadratic suffix deduplication on large documents.
- Test coverage was expanded across dispatch depth, Antigravity model discovery, Codex shared-config patching, chime cleanup, sync locking, release tooling, wizard option discovery, gitignore tracking, and upgrade migration contracts.

## v0.11.0 - 2026-06-03

Replaces Gemini CLI support with the agy-backed Antigravity integration, adds Agent Dispatch for focused second-agent work, ships explicit opt-in Claude/Codex status lines, expands the wizard into a workflow-bundle, CLI-skill, and deterministic answer-file setup flow, hardens upgrade/CI release workflows, and publishes the public best-practice guides from canonical repository docs.

### Added
- **Agentic status lines for Claude Code and Codex**, explicit opt-in per provider. `al wizard` and interactive `al upgrade` can write `agents.claude.statusline = true` or `agents.codex.statusline = true` and seed missing editable sources once. `al sync` then projects `.agent-layer/claude-statusline.sh` to `.claude/claude-statusline.sh` and wires `statusLine` into `.claude/settings.json`; for Codex it injects a managed `[tui].status_line` block into `.codex/config.toml` from `.agent-layer/codex-statusline.toml` (skipped when you define `agent_specific.tui.status_line` yourself). The Claude line renders model, reasoning effort, context %, weekly usage limit, session, directory, git branch/dirty state, lines changed, and session cost; it requires `jq` on `PATH` and degrades to a one-line hint when absent. Absent or explicit `false` disables the statusline. Existing source files are user-owned: sync, wizard, and non-interactive upgrade never overwrite them; interactive upgrade can show a diff and ask before replacing them.
- `al dispatch` and `al dispatch options` for focused headless second-agent work across Codex, Claude, and Antigravity. Dispatch accepts prompt text from arguments or stdin, can invoke a portable Agent Layer skill with `--skill`, supports target selection via `--agent` (including `random`), reports model/reasoning override support through text or JSON options output, streams target answer text to stdout, writes wrapper status/errors to stderr, and uses stable wrapper-owned exit categories. Agent Layer-launched clients receive `AL_DISPATCH_CALLER_AGENT`; dispatched targets receive `AL_DISPATCH_ACTIVE=1` so nested dispatch is blocked.
- `al wizard` now offers five per-agent **feature disable toggles**, folded into the existing model step (most default to **No**, keeping the client's native behavior; the Codex apps toggle is the exception and defaults to **Yes**, disabling apps): disable Codex browser/computer-use (`features.browser_use`/`in_app_browser`/`computer_use`) and built-in apps (`features.apps`); disable Claude's IDE open-file reading (`env.CLAUDE_CODE_AUTO_CONNECT_IDE`), auto-memory (`autoMemoryEnabled`), claude.ai connectors (`env.ENABLE_CLAUDEAI_MCP_SERVERS`), and the AskUserQuestion tool. The first three Claude toggles and the Codex toggles write their client-native `agent_specific` key only when you opt in; the AskUserQuestion toggle writes a typed `agents.claude.disable_question_tool` flag and `al sync` injects the matching `permissions.deny` entry plus a `PreToolUse` hook into `.claude/settings.json`, **merged with** (never replacing) any deny/hook entries you already have. All toggles read back from existing config so re-running the wizard preserves your choice. The Codex "apps" prompt is reworded to the shared "Disable …?" form (its enabled-state storage is unchanged).
- `al wizard` now asks whether to install or refresh the Agent Layer workflow bundle (instruction files, memory templates/docs, and built-in workflow skills). Bare `al init` creates only operational scaffolding with empty `instructions/` and `skills/`; answering "no" in the wizard leaves existing workflow files untouched. Answering "yes" refreshes managed bundled instruction files and workflow skills, creates missing `04_conventions.md` and memory docs/templates, and preserves existing user-owned conventions and memory files.
- `al wizard` now includes an opt-in CLI skill catalog for `tavily-web`, `playwright-cli`, `find-docs`, and `agent-dispatch`. Selected catalog skills are copied into `.agent-layer/skills/<id>/`; unselected catalog skills are removed. `al doctor` checks installed catalog skills for required binaries and reports missing tools without blocking agent launch.
- `al wizard` now detects MCP servers in `config.toml` that are **not** part of the default catalog and asks about them in a dedicated step, separate from the catalog multiselect. Selected servers stay enabled; unselected servers are set to `enabled = false` with their definition preserved — disabling never deletes a custom server (it has no catalog template to restore from). The step is skipped when there are no custom servers, and the apply summary lists any custom servers being disabled.
- `al wizard --answers <file>` for deterministic JSON-driven wizard runs. Answer files can script select, multi-select, confirm, input, and secret-input prompts; the runner bypasses terminal detection, rejects `--profile`/`--yes` conflicts, validates unknown fields, invalid options, multiple JSON values, missing prompts, and unused answers, and gives e2e coverage a stable way to exercise the real wizard flow without PTY automation.
- `al doctor` now prints a **context size summary** after its checks: estimated instruction tokens, skill catalog-metadata tokens (against a ~4,000-token budget), MCP totals (enabled servers, total tools, total tool-schema tokens), and an estimated **total** of the always-loaded token costs (instructions + skill catalog + MCP tool schemas). Configurable metrics show their configured threshold; the skill catalog shows its fixed token budget. The summary always prints — even when values are under threshold and even with `noise_mode = "quiet"` or `al --quiet doctor` — because it is informational, not a warning. Thresholds left unset show `(no limit set)`; components that can't be measured are named in an `(excludes …)` note on the total, and unreachable MCP servers are excluded from totals with a note. A one-off `al --quiet doctor` run suppresses warning-only doctor output while still surfacing failures.
- Antigravity support via `al agy`, backed by `agy --gemini_dir=<repo>/.agy` and repo-local settings under `.agy/antigravity-cli/`.
- `al probe agy` capability probe reports Antigravity permissions, MCP config migration, and runtime MCP discovery status as JSON.
- Public best-practice website guides for skill design, CLI skill design, and instruction design. The release publisher now generates `/skill-design`, `/cli-skill-design`, and `/instruction-design` from the canonical repository docs with public page headers, and `/best-practices` links the guide set together.
- `config_delete_key` and `config_replace_string` upgrade migration operations and a v0.10.2 migration that moves `agents.gemini.enabled` to `agents.antigravity.enabled`, rewrites MCP client lists from `gemini` to `antigravity`, deletes stale Gemini and retired Antigravity desktop config keys, and defaults Antigravity to disabled when no prior Gemini setting exists.
- `make al-agy` developer convenience target.
- `make lint-ci-local` developer target for no-Docker CI-parity golangci-lint runs. It uses disposable Go build, module, and golangci-lint caches with `GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 CGO_ENABLED=0`, and the command is documented in `COMMANDS.md`.

### Changed
- The shipped `al init` template no longer disables Claude Code's **AskUserQuestion** tool by default. Fresh installs now allow the tool (matching Claude Code's native default) instead of seeding `agent_specific.permissions.deny = ["AskUserQuestion"]`. The wizard's new opt-in toggle instead sets `agents.claude.disable_question_tool = true`, and `al sync` injects the `permissions.deny` entry plus a `PreToolUse` hook into `.claude/settings.json` — merged with (never replacing) any deny/hook entries you already have. The hook is what enforces the block under YOLO/`bypassPermissions`, where `permissions.deny` is skipped entirely. Existing repos are unaffected (`config.toml` is never overwritten on upgrade); run `al wizard` to opt back in.
- `al wizard` no longer deletes default MCP servers you unselect. Previously, unticking a catalog default in the wizard pruned its `[[mcp.servers]]` block (and any hand-customization) from `config.toml`. Now an unselected default that already exists is kept with `enabled = false`, matching how custom servers are handled — the wizard never deletes a server block. Selecting a default that is absent still adds it from the embedded catalog; leaving an absent default unselected leaves it absent. Fully removing a server is now a manual `config.toml` edit. Profile/`--yes` runs are unaffected.
- The `al upgrade` migration report no longer prints `[no_op]` rows (migrations that ran but changed nothing because the target was already in the desired state). Only `[applied]` and `[skipped_*]` rows are shown. The report header, target/source versions, and any source-resolution notes still print so diagnostics are preserved. This removes the wall of noise that dominated upgrade output when most migrations were already satisfied.
- The recurring `agent-layer update available` warning (shown on `al sync` and `al <client>` runs) now tells users how to turn it off: set `version_update_on_sync = false` under `[warnings]` in `.agent-layer/config.toml`. The default stays on, and `al doctor`'s update check is unaffected.
- Shipped agent instructions (`01_base.md`) now: direct agents to add real logging/instrumentation to the code to gather evidence on repeated failures instead of guessing; tell agents to zealously preserve context by delegating context-heavy work to subagents; and explicitly encourage scratch scripts and temporary files under `.agent-layer/tmp` for debugging.
- Shipped instruction templates were also tightened: the hard-rule template now leads with grounding unknowns, several generic rules moved out of always-loaded rules, response-style guidance was made explicit, tool-routing now prefers local files/CLIs before MCP or web retrieval when local sources can answer, and relevant skills should be activated automatically from their descriptions.
- The default MCP server catalog now contains the external-tool servers `context7`, `tavily`, `fetch`, and `playwright`. The previous `ripgrep` and `filesystem` catalog entries were removed from the embedded wizard catalog; existing hand-authored MCP server blocks are preserved, and custom servers are now handled by the dedicated custom-server wizard step.
- The release website publisher now stages pages before copying, generates public guide pages from canonical Markdown sources, escapes plain-text angle brackets for MDX safety, builds guide tables of contents from real headings, and keeps versioned-doc publishing idempotent for the target tag.
- CI and release workflows now pin third-party GitHub Actions to immutable commit SHAs with version comments across both workflows.
- Shared skill projection now treats Antigravity as the supported shared-skill consumer in place of Gemini CLI.
- Fresh `al init` now defaults `[agents.antigravity] enabled = false` (the prior `true` default was scoped to the retired Antigravity desktop launcher). Existing repos keep their migrated value from the v0.10.2 migration; users on the retired desktop launcher will have their pre-existing enable flag replaced by the rename from `agents.gemini.enabled` (or the new default if no Gemini config existed). The v0.10.2 row in `site/docs/upgrades.mdx` documents the replacement behavior.
- Claude `reasoning_effort` no longer requires an Opus model. Agent Layer previously failed config validation for `agents.claude.reasoning_effort` unless `agents.claude.model` was an Opus variant — and rejected it outright when the model was unset. That hard error is removed: the value is passed through to Claude Code for any model (including when no model is set), and Claude Code is the authority on which model/effort combinations apply (e.g. Sonnet now supports effort levels). `al wizard` correspondingly offers the reasoning-effort prompt for any enabled Claude model instead of only Opus, and no longer clears the choice when you switch models. Copilot CLI `reasoning_effort` is still rejected, since that client exposes no effort control.
- Wizard and installer status-line source handling now share the same exported source metadata, including canonical paths, legacy Claude source path, template path, and permissions, instead of maintaining separate mappings.

### Fixed
- `al doctor` no longer warns merely because `docs/agent-layer/` is absent in a bare-initialized repo. Bare `al init` intentionally does not create optional workflow memory docs; doctor now warns only when `.agent-layer/instructions/*.md` references `docs/agent-layer` and the directory is missing.
- `al doctor` now reports the configured Copilot CLI enablement state. The default config enables `[agents.copilot_cli]`, but doctor previously omitted that agent row even though sync generated Copilot CLI artifacts.
- Copilot CLI's generated `.copilot/mcp-config.json` now keeps an explicit empty `"mcpServers": {}` object when no Copilot MCP servers are enabled, matching the documented shape and the other MCP client writers.
- `al wizard` now redirects to `al upgrade` when `config.toml` contains a legacy key that only a migration can fix (e.g. a leftover `[agents.gemini]` table). Previously the wizard announced it would help fix the config, then ran `sync`, which re-validated strictly and hard-failed with a raw `config validation failed` error — a dead end, because the wizard's config patch preserves unknown sections verbatim and never runs the rename migration. The wizard now detects this class (a new `ErrConfigNeedsUpgrade` sentinel wrapped by config validation) and prints a clear "run `al upgrade`, then re-run `al wizard`" message, exiting cleanly instead of failing at sync.
- `al doctor`'s Antigravity version check now accepts the bare version string (e.g. `1.0.2`) that `agy --version` prints in Antigravity 1.0.x. Previously the check required an `agy`-prefixed line (`agy 1.0.0`) and reported `[FAIL] Could not parse Antigravity version` against a working install. Multi-line build-timestamp noise is still rejected: the bare form is only accepted when the entire `--version` output is a single version triple.
- Upgrade planning now treats wizard-managed CLI catalog skills as managed files instead of unknown files, and unpinned dev/legacy upgrades can trigger source-agnostic operations across the target-supported manifest chain when legacy Gemini config or missing source-agnostic defaults prove there is migration work to do. Pinned upgrades keep their normal source-to-target chain.
- `al wizard` now reseeds a missing Claude or Codex statusline source when the effective post-wizard config has that provider's statusline enabled, even if you did not re-toggle the setting in the current run. Previously an enabled repo with a deleted source file could complete the wizard and then fail during sync.
- Upgrade diff previews for a missing `.agent-layer/claude-statusline.sh` now show legacy `.agent-layer/statusline.sh` content when that legacy file will seed the new source, and the legacy source is classified as known so upgrade unknown-file scans do not prompt to delete it.
- The Claude statusline now counts untracked-file line changes without spawning one `git diff --no-index` process per untracked file, avoiding prompt stalls in repos with many unignored files.
- The `upgrade-profile-overwrite-claude` e2e scenario now scopes MCP sanitization assertions to the affected server blocks instead of scanning the whole `config.toml`, avoiding future false failures when another server legitimately uses similar fields.

### Removed
- The `al wizard` "Default MCP server entries are missing from config.toml: … Restore them before continuing?" confirm prompt. Missing catalog defaults are now just unselected options in the MCP multiselect — select one to add it, leave it unselected to keep it absent. The prompt was effectively a no-op anyway (it defaulted to "yes" while the multiselect still showed missing defaults unselected, so the rendered config tracked the multiselect, not the answer).
- Gemini CLI sync/client projection, including generated `.gemini/settings.json`, `.gemini/policies/agent-layer.toml`, the global `~/.gemini/trustedFolders.json` write, and the root `GEMINI.md` instruction shim, has been replaced by Antigravity projection. The v0.10.2 migration cleans up any orphan `GEMINI.md` in existing repos. Historical release notes below remain unchanged.
- `al gemini` subcommand removed entirely (no deprecation window). Existing scripts must switch to `al agy`; invoking `al gemini` now produces cobra's standard "unknown command" error.
- Duplicate carry-forward Gemini-to-Antigravity migration operations from the v0.11.0 manifest. Unknown-source upgrades now discover those source-agnostic operations from their original v0.10.2 manifest through the supported-chain planner.
- Internal `buildCodexConfig` test-only shim. Tests now call the System-aware Codex config builder directly.

## v0.10.1 - 2026-05-17

Adds diff-scoped cleanup skills (`prune-new-tests`, `simplify-new-code`) and wires fresh-context reviewer subagents into five existing skills to prevent narrative-driven rationalization. Introduces `al init --here` for in-place installs in subdirectories of existing repos, deep-merges Claude `agent_specific` configuration so `permissions.deny` is additive, auto-writes a Codex per-repo trust stanza, and adds a human-gated merge phase to `ship-pr`.

### Added
- `al init --here` flag installs Agent Layer in the current directory without walking up to an ancestor `.agent-layer/` or `.git`. Lets users add a separate `.agent-layer/` inside a subfolder of an existing repo. When `al init` resolves to an already-initialized ancestor, the error now points at `--here` so the option is discoverable.
- `agent_specific.permissions.deny = ["AskUserQuestion"]` shipped in the install seed (`internal/templates/config.toml`). Fresh `al init` now disables Claude Code's structured clarification-question tool by default; remove the line to keep it. Existing repos are unaffected.
- `prune-new-tests` skill — burden-of-proof pruning of tests added in the current uncommitted diff. Each added test must defend its existence with a concrete production-code mutation that would flip its assertion or it is auto-deleted. Surviving coverage gaps are reported, never backfilled. Uses a fresh-context reviewer subagent so the implementer's narrative cannot rationalize speculative tests into surviving.
- `simplify-new-code` skill — diff-scoped scope-creep removal. Scans the current uncommitted diff for agent-added speculative flexibility, premature abstractions, dead branches, impossible-case error handling, defensive scaffolding, clever patterns, and half-finished work, and auto-applies simplifications while preserving the user-requested behavior. Uses a fresh-context reviewer subagent that identifies scope creep by pattern, not by comparison to the request.

### Changed
- Built-in skill frontmatter descriptions are shorter and more routing-focused, reducing Claude skill listing budget pressure while keeping key trigger language.
- `simplify-code` skill renamed to `simplify-codebase` and scoped explicitly to the codebase (full repository or explicit paths). The implicit "if uncommitted changes exist, scope to the diff" branch is removed — `simplify-new-code` is the diff-scoped sibling. All in-repo callouts updated: diff-context skills (`debug-issue`, `complete-current-phase`, `fix-issues`, `implement-plan`, `audit-and-fix-uncommitted-changes`) now point at `simplify-new-code`; codebase-context skill (`improve-codebase`) points at `simplify-codebase`.
- `implement-plan` skill inserts mandatory cleanup phases between implementation and verification: Phase 4 runs `prune-new-tests` whenever tests were added, Phase 5 runs `simplify-new-code` whenever production code was added or modified, and Phase 6 (renumbered from 4) handles plan-vs-implementation verification.
- `audit-and-fix-uncommitted-changes` skill adds Phase 0.5 (Pre-pass Cleanup) that runs `prune-new-tests` and `simplify-new-code` before any review round, so reviewers don't spend budget on code about to be pruned.
- `verify-against-plan` skill restructured around a plan-anchored, narrative-blind fresh-context reviewer subagent. Phase 2 now delegates plan-vs-implementation comparison to a subagent that sees only the plan and the post-implementation state — never the implementer's narrative, prior conversation, or deviation rationalizations.
- `address-pr-comments` Phase 6 (reply audit) restructured around a fresh-context reviewer subagent. The original author's replies are audited by a subagent that sees only the comment, the reply, and (for `Fixed` verdicts) the named commit's diff — not the agent's prior reasoning when authoring the replies.
- `improve-codebase` Phase 3 per-chunk re-audit restructured around a fresh-context reviewer subagent. The post-fix chunk and the originating findings are the only inputs; the fixer's narrative is excluded so sunk-cost reasoning ("we just fixed that") cannot rubber-stamp incomplete fixes.
- Claude `agent_specific` is now deep-merged into `.claude/settings.json` for object values (arrays and scalars still replace at their key). Previously, top-level objects were replaced wholesale. `permissions.deny` is additive and does not trigger an override warning; `permissions.allow` continues to warn when present.
- Codex sync now writes `[projects."<repo root>"] trust_level = "trusted"` to repo-local `.codex/config.toml`, preserving Codex's exact absolute-path trust semantics without requiring a per-repo `agents.codex.agent_specific.projects` passthrough. The `agent_specific.projects` override warning is path-aware: it only fires when the user's `projects` map contains the managed repo root (real collision), not when it lists unrelated paths that coexist with the managed entry.
- `ship-pr` skill adds a human-gated Phase 9: the agent merges the PR only when the user replies with the exact phrase `I approve merging PR #<N>` matching the run's PR number, using an unambiguous GitHub merge method or pausing for a strategy choice when multiple methods are available; on a successful merge it deletes the source branch locally and remotely. The skill refuses to delete the repository's default branch.
- `ship-pr` skill adds an upfront "Continuation rule" framing sub-skill returns as intermediate, not terminal. Addresses a recurring failure where the orchestrator stopped after `audit-and-fix-uncommitted-changes` returned, mistaking the sub-skill's closeout summary for ship-pr's completion.

## v0.10.0 - 2026-05-07

Consolidates skill projection into a shared `.agents/skills/` directory for non-Claude clients, migrates Gemini sync to the Policy Engine, splits the MCP catalog from the install seed, adds `xhigh` reasoning effort for Claude, and improves the upgrade experience with automatic post-upgrade sync and opt-in diff preview.

### Added
- Skills synced to a shared `.agents/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` tree for non-Claude clients (Codex, Gemini, Antigravity, VS Code/Copilot, Copilot CLI). Per-client directories (`.codex/skills/`, `.gemini/skills/`, `.agent/skills/`, `.vscode/prompts/`, `.github/skills/`) are retired and cleaned automatically by `al sync`. Projection rules and ownership contract documented in `docs/SKILL-CLIENT-SPEC.md`.
- `chat.agentSkillsLocations` written to `.vscode/settings.json` pointing at `.agents/skills/` so VS Code Copilot picks up the consolidated location.
- `xhigh` as a valid `reasoning_effort` value for Claude. Custom (unknown) effort values now pass through with a warning instead of a hard validation error.
- `_generatedBy: agent-layer` provenance field added to generated `.mcp.json` and `.gemini/settings.json` for stronger ownership detection during upgrade readiness checks; replaces the weak `mcpServers`-only signature.
- Internal MCP server catalog (`mcp-catalog.toml`) embedded in the binary and consumed by `al wizard` for its MCP server multiselect; decoupled from the install seed so fresh `config.toml` files start with a minimal `[mcp]` section.

### Changed
- Gemini sync migrates from the deprecated `tools.allowed` field to the Policy Engine. `WriteGeminiSettings` no longer emits `tools.allowed` in `.gemini/settings.json` and instead writes a `policyPaths: [".gemini/policies"]` pointer; `WriteGeminiPolicies` generates `.gemini/policies/agent-layer.toml` with one `[[rule]]` block per allowed command (`toolName = "run_shell_command"`, `commandPrefix`, `decision = "allow"`, `priority = 100`, `allowRedirection = true`). `allowRedirection = true` preserves the previous `tools.allowed` behavior for headless workflows that pipe output (e.g., `git ... > file`). Resolves the Gemini CLI deprecation warning.
- `al upgrade` now runs `al sync` automatically on success so retired projection paths and freshly-introduced templates are reconciled without a manual follow-up. Sync warnings surface on stderr; sync failures are wrapped (`upgrade applied; sync failed: <err> (run \`al sync\` to retry)`) with `errors.Is` preserved, and the "Upgrade successful." banner is suppressed when sync fails so the failure is unmissable.
- `al upgrade` overwrite prompts now show a compact summary (file path with `+N -M` line stats, colorized when output is a terminal) and ask "View the full diff?" (default no) before printing unified diff bodies.
- `.agent-layer/tmp/` excluded from pre-upgrade snapshots; rollback does not restore tmp content. Interactive bulk-delete prompt is scoped to non-tmp content; a separate grouped prompt handles tmp unknowns. Non-interactive deletion requires `--apply-tmp-deletions`; `--apply-deletions` alone never touches tmp.
- `config.toml` install seed no longer includes inline MCP server entries; the `[mcp]` section now points to `al wizard` for server configuration. Existing repos are unaffected.
- Stale `.claude/skills/` and `.gemini/skills/` directories flagged for cleanup during upgrade readiness when those agents are disabled.

### Fixed
- `.mcp.json` no longer omits the `mcpServers` key when no servers are configured.
- Rollback no longer silently wipes `.agent-layer/tmp/` content that was excluded from the snapshot.
- Grouped tmp-unknowns deletion fallback fixed when `DeleteUnknownTmpAllFunc` is not wired in `PromptFuncs`.
- Env preview redaction edge cases in `al wizard` hardened.
- Doctor and wizard previews hardened for additional edge cases.

### Removed
- `tools.allowed` field from generated `.gemini/settings.json`. The next `al sync` rewrites the file in the new shape, removing the deprecated key.
- Per-client skill directories (`.codex/skills/`, `.gemini/skills/`, `.agent/skills/`, `.vscode/prompts/`, `.github/skills/`) retired; `al sync` cleans these paths and writes to `.agents/skills/` instead.

## v0.9.2 - 2026-03-21

Adds GitHub Copilot CLI as a supported agent client, introduces context files for plan/task artifacts, supports `max` reasoning effort for Claude Opus, and consolidates internal abstractions for cleaner dependency injection. Instructions and skills are improved for better autonomy and tradeoff handling.

### Added
- GitHub Copilot CLI integration: new `al copilot` command, sync support, config fields (`[agents.copilot_cli]`), wizard catalog entries, doctor checks, and v0.9.2 migration manifest. Stale Copilot artifacts (`.copilot/mcp-config.json`, managed skill dirs under `.github/skills/`) are cleaned when the agent is disabled.
- Context file (`.context.md`) for plan/task artifact system. Captures key file paths, current state, constraints, and an entry point so implementing agents can orient immediately without re-discovering what the planner found. Produced by `plan-work` (Phase 3b), consumed by `implement-plan`, `review-plan`, `verify-against-plan`, and other plan-aware skills.
- `max` as a valid `reasoning_effort` value for Claude Opus models. Since Claude Code only supports `max` as a session-scoped CLI flag, all effort values are now passed via `--effort` and `max` is excluded from `settings.json` sync.
- Memory hygiene improvements in instruction and doc templates: "What NOT to store" section in `02_memory.md`, character-budget awareness rule (~8k chars / ~2k tokens per file), completed-phase archival guidance in `ROADMAP.md` template, and entry-ID placeholder update from "abcdef" to "short-slug".
- Explicit "Upgrade successful." message when `al upgrade` completes, resolving ambiguous output on no-op completions.
- Nil guard for `sys.HTTPClient()` in `downloadHTTPClientWithSystem`, falling back to `defaultHTTPClient` when the System implementation returns nil.
- `INSTRUCTION-DESIGN.md` internal reference document for instruction authoring principles.

### Changed
- `--effort` CLI flag now respects `agent_specific.effortLevel` override: when the override is set, the managed `--effort` arg is skipped so the user's setting takes precedence.
- Model catalogs updated: added `gemini-3.1-flash-lite`, `opus[1m]`, `gpt-5.4`; removed deprecated `gemini-2.0-*`, `gpt-5/5.1-*`, `claude-sonnet-4.5`.
- Instruction quality improvements: removed rules that duplicate baseline model behavior, strengthened tradeoff protocol to require at least two options with pros/cons, added memory pruning rule for DECISIONS.md and CONTEXT.md.
- `audit-documentation` and `audit-tests` skills rewritten to fix autonomously with human checkpoints for genuine tradeoffs instead of dual report-only/fix-mode pattern. `audit-tests` now autonomously deletes rubber-stamp tests, consolidates duplicates, and combats agent-caused test bloat. All 22 skills receive a tradeoff checkpoint for standalone distribution.
- `ship-pr` skill fixes two edge cases: on a non-default branch with no uncommitted changes, proceeds to create the PR; on the default branch with uncommitted changes, creates a new branch before committing.
- Dispatch System interface expanded: replaced package-level mutable function stubs (`osStat`, `osChmod`, `osRename`, `lockFileFn`, `flockFn`, `dispatchSleep`, `httpClient`, etc.) with methods on the System interface for proper dependency injection.
- Duplicate abstractions consolidated: approval mode constants unified into `config.ApprovalMode*`, agent-enabled helpers unified into `config.IsAgentEnabled`.
- Skills docs page restructured: orchestrator/primary/supporting tiers with recommended workflow section, separated universal skill standard from Agent Layer-specific features.
- Gitignore template updated to include `open-vscode.sh` and compiled `al` binary.

### Fixed
- `--effort` flag no longer shadows user's `agent_specific.effortLevel` override in Claude Code.
- `ship-pr` no longer stalls on a non-default branch with no uncommitted changes and no longer tries to commit on the default branch without creating a feature branch first.
- Nil panic prevented when `System.HTTPClient()` returns nil in download paths.
- **Security:** Updated `github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk` from v1.4.0 to v1.4.1 to fix improper handling of null Unicode character when parsing JSON (high severity).

### Improved
- Expanded automated test coverage across Copilot CLI sync, dispatch System interface, model catalogs, gitignore templates, effort flag paths, and instruction template assertions.

## v0.9.1 - 2026-03-07

Overhauls the built-in skill library from 10 to 22 structured, workflow-driven skills and introduces a user-managed conventions file so you can tailor project-specific rules without losing them on upgrade. Instructions are reordered, deduplicated, and compressed for better agent compliance.

### Added
- New user-managed `04_conventions.md` instruction template for project-specific conventions (architecture, code quality, data safety, time/data, environment). Seeded on `al init`, never overwritten on `al upgrade`; future convention updates delivered via `append_to_file` migrations with duplicate detection.
- New `append_to_file` migration kind for delivering content to user-managed files without overwriting edits. Supports duplicate-detection via match string, automatic file creation, and atomic writes.
- New `delete_file` migration operations for removing deprecated skill directories during upgrade.
- 17 new built-in skills following a normalized workflow-driven structure with explicit phases, global constraints, guardrails, and human checkpoints: `address-pr-comments`, `audit-and-fix-uncommitted-changes`, `audit-memory`, `audit-tests`, `complete-current-phase`, `debug-issue`, `fix-ci`, `implement-plan`, `improve-codebase`, `plan-work`, `repair-checks`, `resolve-findings`, `review-scope`, `schedule-backlog`, `ship-pr`, `simplify-code`, `verify-against-plan`.
- Site documentation page for built-in skills (`site/docs/skills.mdx`) covering the full 22-skill library organized by category with usage examples and customization guidance.
- Site documentation page for evidence-based skill design (`site/pages/skill-design.mdx`) with 5 core design principles and 18 academic/industry citations.
- Internal skill authoring reference (`docs/SKILL-DESIGN.md`) and audit workflow specification (`docs/SKILL-AUDIT.md`).

### Changed
- Instruction files reordered for primacy effect: `02_rules.md` → `00_rules.md`, `00_base.md` → `01_base.md`, `01_memory.md` → `02_memory.md`. Hard constraints now load first to improve model compliance. `al upgrade` migrates existing repos via `rename_file` operations.
- Cross-file instruction duplicates removed: 6 items that appeared in multiple instruction files consolidated to a single canonical location, reducing ~57 instructions to ~50.
- Verbose instruction sections compressed (~50% fewer tokens in Critical Protocol, Workflow & Safety, and Tools sections) without removing guidance.
- UTC-only internals and No system Python rules moved from `02_rules.md` to `04_conventions.md` as project-specific conventions (delivered to existing users via `append_to_file` migrations).
- 5 existing built-in skills restructured to normalized workflow pattern: `audit-documentation`, `boost-coverage`, `finish-task`, `fix-issues`, `review-plan`.
- Decision hygiene guidance updated: superseded decisions should be replaced (not accumulated), and entries that become self-evident from the codebase should be removed.
- Skill loader error message for directories missing a skill file shortened from "missing SKILL.md or skill.md" to "has no SKILL.md".
- Site docs sidebar positions updated to accommodate new Skills page; upgrade-checklist shell examples consolidated.

### Removed
- 5 built-in skills replaced by normalized workflow equivalents: `cleanup-code` (→ `simplify-code`), `continue-roadmap` (→ `complete-current-phase`), `find-issues` (→ `resolve-findings`), `fix-tests` (→ `repair-checks`), `update-roadmap` (→ `schedule-backlog`). Migration manifest deletes these (plus `mechanical-cleanup`) from user directories during upgrade.

### Improved
- Expanded automated test coverage for user-owned instruction files (seed-on-init, no-overwrite-on-upgrade, excluded-from-diffs), `append_to_file` migration paths (apply, no-op, file creation, rollback), normalized workflow skill structure validation, artifact naming conventions, and skill deletion migration scenarios.

## v0.9.0 - 2026-03-01

### Added
- Added a reusable `internal/skillvalidator` package with parse/validate separation and deterministic findings for agentskills.io-aligned skill validation.
- Added `al doctor` skills diagnostics for standards checks (unknown frontmatter keys, name/path mismatches, and non-canonical directory filenames such as `skill.md`).
- Added release manifests for `v0.9.0`: `internal/templates/migrations/0.9.0.json` and `internal/templates/manifests/0.9.0.json`.
- Added `al doctor` check for stale flat-format skill files (`.md` at skills root) with guidance to run `al upgrade`.
- Added `CONTEXT.md` memory file template for general-purpose project context, domain concepts, naming conventions, and lessons learned.
- Added data-driven breaking-change display: migration manifests now carry `breaking`, `breaking_notice`, and `breaking_details` fields, and the upgrade report renders them generically instead of hardcoding per-kind display logic.
- Added yellow highlighting for readiness warnings, file-removal counts, and review-needed items in upgrade plan and upgrade output for improved scanability.
- Upgrade snapshot rollback now accepts snapshots in `created` status, enabling recovery from interrupted upgrades that failed before reaching `applied` status.

### Changed
- Renamed legacy "slash command" source and output terminology to "skills" across config, sync pipelines, templates, and docs.
- Canonicalized source layout to `.agent-layer/skills/`, with migrations that rename legacy `.agent-layer/slash-commands/` and embedded skill template paths.
- **Breaking:** Flat-format skills (`<name>.md`) are no longer supported by the skill loader. All skills must use directory format (`<name>/SKILL.md`). `al upgrade` migrates both built-in and user-authored skills automatically via a single `migrate_skills_format` operation with pre-flight conflict detection and user confirmation.
- Skill frontmatter parsing/generation now uses YAML (`go.yaml.in/yaml/v3`) with support for `name`, `description`, `license`, `compatibility`, `metadata`, and `allowed-tools`, while keeping unknown fields parse-tolerant for portability.
- Increased skill parser/validator single-line scanner caps to `8 MiB` to reduce token-limit failures on large single-line skill content.
- Documentation now explicitly states that missing or empty skill `description` is load-enforced (fail-loud), while missing `name` remains backward-compatible with doctor warnings.
- Skills migration user-facing copy updated to "Slash-commands renamed to skills" with data-driven breaking-change notices sourced from the migration manifest.
- Unknown-file scanning now covers both `.agent-layer/` and `docs/agent-layer/`, with a fresh post-migration re-scan so the unknown-file prompt reflects actual post-migration state instead of stale pre-migration paths.
- Migration-covered diff suppression now uses ancestor-directory matching, so migrations that own an entire directory (e.g., skills format migration) suppress noisy per-file template diffs in plan output.
- Git safety instruction now clarifies that commit/push authorization applies only to the specific request and does not carry forward.

### Fixed
- `al doctor` lenient-config fallback now best-effort loads skills, preventing false "No skills configured" results when strict config validation fails.
- Skill name handling is now Unicode NFKC-aware across loading and validation paths, preventing false duplicates/mismatches for normalization-equivalent names.
- Skill metadata and text limits now use rune counts (not bytes), and validation now rejects empty names and non-ASCII digit forms in slug normalization.
- Directory-format loading now accepts lowercase `skill.md` as a compatibility fallback while preserving canonical `SKILL.md` precedence.

### Removed
- Removed `docs/agent-layer/SKILLS_WORKFLOWS.md`; workflow guidance is now provided by individual skill sources.

### Improved
- Expanded automated coverage across skill loading/validation, upgrade migrations, prompt generation, install ownership/readiness checks, and docs surfaces touched by the skills-standard migration.
- Updated default embedded skills to canonical agentskills directory format (`skills/<name>/SKILL.md`) and aligned memory/workflow docs for Phase 15 completion.

## v0.8.8 - 2026-02-25

### Added
- Added embedded upgrade migration manifest support for `v0.8.8` to canonicalize the Claude VS Code agent key from `agents.claude-vscode.enabled` to `agents.claude_vscode.enabled` and enforce a default for the canonical key.
- Expanded branch-coverage suites across upgrade/install, dispatch, wizard PTY interactions, and command paths to harden release confidence.

### Changed
- Canonical config/docs naming now uses `[agents.claude_vscode]` (snake_case). Legacy `[agents.claude-vscode]` remains accepted at load time and is migrated during upgrade.
- Release and upgrade-doc validation checks are stricter, including stronger release workflow/docs contract assertions and stable-tag publishing guardrails.
- `cmd/publish-site` release version-retention and versioned-doc pruning behavior is more robust for deterministic stable release publication.

### Fixed
- Made dispatch cache sync-error coverage deterministic by injecting sync failures in tests instead of relying on platform-specific `/dev/null` behavior.
- Aligned upgrade/readiness messaging and docs references to the canonical `claude_vscode` key to avoid mixed-key guidance.

### Improved
- Removed obsolete Claude-specific GitHub workflow files in favor of the current release/verification workflow set.
- Updated README and site docs for key-name consistency and release guidance clarity.

## v0.8.7 - 2026-02-24

### Added
- `al <client>` commands now support `--quiet` / `-q` for one-off quiet runs that suppress Agent Layer informational output while preserving client output and error exit behavior.
- Added end-to-end coverage for quiet Claude runs to ensure `al claude --quiet` emits no Agent Layer output and still launches correctly.
- Wizard back-navigation support: pressing `Esc` now moves to the previous step, with explicit first-step exit confirmation and deterministic state rollback behavior for partial selections.
- Wizard `Ctrl+C` now exits immediately without saving, distinct from `Esc` (back). Both keys are shown as hints in the bottom navigation bar (`esc back • ctrl+c exit`).
- Config guardrail test for required fields: automated enforcement now checks that newly required config fields have matching `config_set_default` migration coverage (with explicit legacy baseline allowlist).
- Claude reasoning-effort support in wizard/config/sync paths (`low|medium|high`), including projection into `.claude/settings.json` as `effortLevel`.

### Changed
- `warnings.noise_mode` now supports `quiet` in addition to `default` and `reduce`.
- Quiet handling is now applied consistently across dispatch and client launch paths, including argument forwarding and no-sync execution.
- Wizard-managed `config.toml` writes now use an explicit preferred section order policy (`approvals`, enabled agents, `mcp`, `warnings`) instead of implicitly coupling ordering to template parse order.
- Upgrade diff output is now colorized in interactive terminals for better scanability (adds/removes/hunks), with plain-text fallback preserved for non-interactive and no-color environments.
- Wizard profile apply flow now warns when replacing an existing TOML-corrupt `.agent-layer/config.toml`.

### Fixed
- `al sync` warning-only outcomes in quiet mode now preserve non-zero exit behavior without printing warning text.
- Quiet-mode behavior now avoids leaking dispatch/update-check banners when quiet is enabled via flag or config.
- Prevented hidden behavior drift in multiline TOML patching by refactoring duplicated state tracking into a shared iterator with regression coverage across call sites.
- Gemini `reasoning_effort` is now rejected explicitly with a clear validation error instead of allowing ambiguous/unsupported behavior.
- Claude reasoning-effort validation now fails loudly for invalid option values and unsupported model selections.

### Improved
- Documentation and default config comments now describe quiet-mode behavior and its interaction with `al doctor` (which always prints warnings).
- Validation and warning messaging now includes `quiet` as a first-class supported noise mode.
- Expanded test coverage for wizard back-navigation state transitions, profile corruption warning paths, reasoning-effort capability validation, Claude sync projection behavior, and upgrade diff color/no-color rendering.
- Added PTY integration tests for wizard Esc/Ctrl+C keystroke classification, validating the full chain from raw terminal bytes through bubbletea to error classification.
- Updated project memory/docs (`ISSUES.md`, `BACKLOG.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, `DECISIONS.md`, `README.md`) to reflect completed sprint scope and release-facing behavior.

## v0.8.6 - 2026-02-23

### Added
- `al wizard` now prompts to enable per-repo Claude settings and caches isolation (`local_config_dir`) when Claude or Claude VS Code is enabled. Default is `false` (shared global config); selecting `true` sets `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` to a repo-local directory for separate settings and caches per repository.

### Fixed
- `.gitignore` template inline comments on `/.claude/` and `/.claude-config/` patterns were treated by Git as part of the literal pattern, causing both directories to not be gitignored. Comments moved to their own lines. Affected users (v0.8.5 installs): run `al upgrade` or `al sync` to pick up the corrected template.

### Improved
- Per-repo isolation is now documented as a core feature in the README comparison table, key properties, and a dedicated [Per-repo credential isolation](https://conn-castle.github.io/agent-layer-web/docs/concepts#per-repo-credential-isolation) section in the site concepts page (Codex auth isolation plus Claude settings and caches isolation; Claude auth remains shared due to an upstream limitation).

## v0.8.5 - 2026-02-23

### Added
- Optional agent-specific passthrough configuration for Claude and Codex via `agents.claude.agent_specific` and `agents.codex.agent_specific`.
- Optional `agents.claude.local_config_dir` support for repo-local Claude config isolation (`.claude-config`). `al vscode` sets `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` only when both `local_config_dir = true` and `agents.claude-vscode.enabled = true`.
- `al upgrade rollback --list` support to inspect available snapshot IDs and statuses before executing rollback.
- `al sync` now auto-adds the repository root to `~/.gemini/trustedFolders.json` when Gemini is enabled so Gemini CLI reliably loads project-level `.gemini/settings.json`. If this write fails, sync still succeeds and emits a non-fatal warning with manual remediation guidance.

### Changed
- Agent-specific passthrough keys intentionally override Agent Layer-managed keys when they collide, with sync warnings to keep overrides explicit.
- `al vscode` now clears `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` only when it points at the repo-local `.claude-config`; user-defined non-repo values are preserved.
- Codex sync now writes `agents.codex.agent_specific` keys before managed MCP tables so top-level overrides remain at the TOML root.

### Fixed
- Config parsing now rejects unrecognized keys during strict decode instead of silently ignoring them, with actionable validation guidance in the returned error.
- `.env` parsing now correctly handles quoted values, escaped newline/carriage-return sequences, and invalid trailing characters after quoted values.
- MCP tool-name collision warnings are deterministic: warning subjects and per-tool server lists are sorted for stable output.
- Upgrade `config_set_default` prompts no longer mark one choice as "recommended"; migration manifest values are still pre-selected but users must make an explicit choice.
- `al upgrade` now accepts zero-byte snapshot file entries, fixing failures where unknown empty files previously produced `requires content_base64` errors.
- `al gemini` no longer fails MCP discovery for the internal `agent-layer` server when PATH `al` is a non-runnable repo-pin shim. Prompt-server command resolution now prefers local source execution (`go run <repo>/cmd/al mcp-prompts`) when available, `al mcp-prompts` bypasses repo-pin dispatch, and prompt-server source roots are validated as the Agent Layer module.

### Improved
- Expanded automated coverage for root/upgrade command paths, Gemini trust flows, upgrade-readiness helpers, warning policy branches, prompt-server root resolution, dispatch behavior, and codex/claude agent-specific config rendering.
- Added e2e coverage for upgrade flows that include empty unknown files and for wizard MCP sanitization behavior when profile defaults disable an injected server block.
- Website documentation now includes `al upgrade rollback --list` guidance, Gemini trusted-folder remediation notes, and expanded agent-specific and repo-local Claude configuration guidance.

## v0.8.4 - 2026-02-20

### Fixed
- Version dispatch no longer prints the version-source diagnostic twice when a pinned or environment-overridden version dispatches to a cached binary. The diagnostic now prints only from the binary that actually runs the command.

### Changed
- Config validation now silently strips transport-incompatible MCP server fields instead of rejecting the config with an error. For example, `headers` on a stdio server or `command`/`args` on an HTTP server are removed during validation rather than causing a load failure. This makes configs more resilient to leftover fields from transport changes or manual editing.

### Improved
- `al wizard` config patching now removes dotted sub-key lines (e.g., `headers.Authorization = "Bearer ..."`) when stripping a parent key like `headers`. Previously, only inline-table syntax (`headers = { ... }`) was handled.
- Scenario-based end-to-end test framework with 26 scenarios and 436 assertions replaces the previous monolithic e2e script. Covers fresh install, wizard profiles, upgrade paths, error propagation, agent launch, and rollback workflows with mock agent binaries.

## v0.8.3 - 2026-02-19

### Fixed
- `al doctor` lenient config fallback now injects built-in environment variables (e.g., `AL_REPO_ROOT`), fixing false "missing environment variables" warnings for MCP servers like `filesystem` that reference `${AL_REPO_ROOT}` in their args.
- `al wizard` now sanitizes transport-incompatible MCP server fields during config patching. For example, leftover `headers` on a stdio server or leftover `command`/`args` on an HTTP server are automatically removed. Previously, the wizard would complete successfully but `al sync` would fail with a validation error, creating a circular "run wizard to fix" loop.

## v0.8.2 - 2026-02-18

### Added
- Migration manifest chaining: `al upgrade` now loads all intermediate migration manifests between the source and target versions during multi-version jumps. Users upgrading from 0.8.0 to 0.8.2 will receive migrations introduced in intermediate releases.
- Config resilience: `al wizard`, `al doctor`, and `al upgrade` now use lenient config parsing so they always work even on broken or incomplete configs. Runtime commands remain strict with actionable guidance.

### Changed
- The `agents.claude-vscode.enabled` config migration has been moved from the v0.8.1 manifest to v0.8.2. This ensures all users (including those who installed v0.8.1 before the migration was added) receive the prompt during upgrade.

### Fixed
- Users jumping multiple versions (e.g., 0.8.0 to 0.8.2) no longer miss intermediate migration operations.

### Removed
- Slash command `auto-approve` frontmatter. Approval permissions are controlled entirely by `approvals.mode`.

### Improved
- Slash command frontmatter now rejects unrecognized keys with a clear error, catching typos and unsupported fields early.

## v0.8.1 - 2026-02-18

### Added
- `[agents.claude-vscode]` config section for Claude Code VS Code Extension support. `al vscode` is the single command for launching VS Code with both Codex and Claude extension settings based on which agents are enabled.
- `approvals.mode = "yolo"` for maximum agent autonomy: skips all permission prompts (Claude `--dangerously-skip-permissions`, Gemini `--approval-mode=yolo`, Codex `approval_policy=never` + `sandbox_mode=danger-full-access`, VS Code `chat.tools.global.autoApprove`). Intended for sandboxed/ephemeral environments.
- Slash command `auto-approve` frontmatter: `auto-approve: true` auto-approves MCP prompt retrieval for that skill in Claude clients. It does not auto-approve agent actions after reading the prompt; those remain governed by `approvals.mode`.
- Upgrade readiness checks now detect stale disabled-agent artifacts for `.claude/settings.json`.

### Changed
- `al vscode` now launches when either `[agents.vscode]` or `[agents.claude-vscode]` is enabled in `config.toml`, unifying both extensions under a single launch command.
- `CODEX_HOME` is now cleared from the VS Code process environment when `[agents.vscode]` is disabled, preventing stale Codex configuration leakage when only Claude VS Code is enabled.
- Release process now includes a preflight gate (`make release-preflight RELEASE_TAG=vX.Y.Z`) that validates upgrade-contract documentation before tagging.

### Fixed
- `al vscode` no longer appends `.` when pass-through arguments include a positional path or file argument. (#51)
- Sync warning exit behavior restored: non-suppressible warnings correctly propagate exit status regardless of `noise_mode` setting.

## v0.8.0 - 2026-02-16

### Added
- New upgrade command surface centered on `al upgrade`: `al upgrade plan` (dry-run preview), `al upgrade rollback <snapshot-id>` (manual restore), `al upgrade prefetch --version X.Y.Z` (cache warm-up), and `al upgrade repair-gitignore-block` (managed block repair).
- `al upgrade plan` now produces plain-language categorized upgrade previews with readiness checks and line-level diff previews (default 40 lines per file, configurable via `--diff-lines`).
- Upgrade planning ownership inference is now deterministic and offline using committed release manifests (`internal/templates/manifests/*.json`) plus repo baseline state (`.agent-layer/state/managed-baseline.json`).
- `al upgrade` now creates managed-file snapshots under `.agent-layer/state/upgrade-snapshots/` and automatically rolls back transactional changes when an upgrade step fails.
- Embedded per-release migration engine: `al upgrade` executes migration manifests (`internal/templates/migrations/<target>.json`) before template writes and emits deterministic migration reports.
- `al wizard` now supports non-interactive profile mode (`--profile`, optional `--yes`) and backup cleanup (`--cleanup-backups`).
- Warning noise control added via `warnings.noise_mode` (`default` or `reduce`) to reduce non-critical suppressible warning output when desired.

### Changed
- **Breaking:** `al init` is now one-time scaffolding only. If `.agent-layer/` already exists, `al init` errors and directs users to `al upgrade plan` + `al upgrade`.
- **Breaking:** `al upgrade` non-interactive execution now requires `--yes` plus explicit apply flags (`--apply-managed-updates`, `--apply-memory-updates`, `--apply-deletions`) to make mutation intent explicit.
- `.agent-layer/.env` and `.agent-layer/config.toml` are now strictly user-owned: seeded only when missing and never overwritten by init/upgrade operations.
- `.agent-layer/.gitignore` is treated as internal agent-owned state: always rewritten from templates and excluded from upgrade plans/diff prompts.
- Default MCP server templates now pin concrete tool versions by default, with inline floating/latest opt-in examples for teams that want automatic upstream updates.
- Update-check handling now degrades gracefully on GitHub API rate limits so init/doctor flows continue with actionable warning output.
- Release process now requires generating and committing a per-tag template ownership manifest before tagging (`./scripts/generate-template-manifest.sh --tag vX.Y.Z`).

### Fixed
- `al upgrade rollback <snapshot-id>` now rejects path separators in snapshot IDs, preventing path traversal attempts during manual rollback resolution.
- `al vscode` launch preflight now fails fast with explicit guidance when the `code` CLI is missing on `PATH` or when `.vscode/settings.json` has a managed-block marker conflict.

### Removed
- **Breaking:** `al init --overwrite` and `al init --force` have been removed. Use `al upgrade plan` and `al upgrade` for upgrades/repairs.
- **Breaking:** `al upgrade --force` has been removed. Use explicit apply flags (plus `--yes` for non-interactive runs) to select mutation categories.
- **Breaking:** `al upgrade plan --json` has been removed; text output is now the only supported plan interface.

## v0.7.0 - 2026-02-07

### Added
- Upgrade contract published at `site/docs/upgrades.mdx`: defines upgrade event categories (`safe auto`, `needs review`, `breaking/manual`), sequential compatibility guarantees (`N-1` to `N`), release-versioned migration rules, and OS/shell capability matrix.
- Release gate validates upgrade documentation for each release tag (`make docs-upgrade-check`), ensuring migration table rows exist and placeholder text is replaced when changelog notes breaking changes.
- `al init --version latest` resolves the latest GitHub release to a semver pin before writing `.agent-layer/al.version`.
- `al init --version X.Y.Z` validates the release exists on GitHub before writing the pin file, failing with a clear "release not found" message instead of writing a pin that 404s on next use.
- `al init` auto-recovers from empty or corrupt `.agent-layer/al.version` pin files with a warning instead of blocking all commands.
- Binary download progress indicator: `ensureCachedBinary` emits "Downloading al vX.Y.Z..." / "Downloaded al vX.Y.Z" to stderr.
- Actionable error messages for binary download failures (404 not-found and timeout scenarios).

### Changed
- **Breaking:** Windows support removed. Deleted `al-install.ps1` installer, Windows release target, `open-vscode.bat` launcher, and all Windows-specific code paths in dispatch, cache, exec, and lock packages. Windows was never tested and best-effort support eroded trust. macOS and Linux remain fully supported.
- `al init` now bypasses repo-pin binary dispatch and always executes on the invoking CLI binary, preventing older pinned versions from running upgrade operations.
- Launcher template writes refactored for reliability with proper macOS path escaping.
- Codex MCP header projection order corrected.
- CI workflow caches pinned tools in GitHub Actions for faster builds.
- Upgrade contract linked from README, site docs, DEVELOPMENT.md, and RELEASE.md.

### Removed
- `al-install.ps1` (Windows PowerShell installer).
- `open-vscode.bat` (Windows VS Code launcher).
- Windows release targets (`windows/amd64`) from build scripts.
- Windows-specific dispatch, cache, exec, and lock code paths.

## v0.6.1 - 2026-02-06

### Added
- CLI argument forwarding: `al <client>` now forwards extra arguments to the underlying client. Use `--` to separate Agent Layer flags from client arguments (e.g., `al claude -- --help` or `al vscode --no-sync -- --reuse-window`).
- VS Code launchers are now created during `al init` in addition to `al sync`, so launchers are available immediately after initialization.
- `.gitignore` managed block is now updated during both `al init` and `al sync` operations for consistency.

### Fixed
- `AL_SHIM_ACTIVE` environment variable no longer leaks into VS Code's integrated terminal when launching via `al vscode`. Previously, this caused subsequent `al` commands in the terminal to fail with "version dispatch already active" errors. (#46)
- Wizard now rewrites `config.toml` sections in the template-defined canonical order, preventing section ordering drift after multiple wizard runs.

### Changed
- Launcher code moved to `internal/launchers` package with exported `EnsureGitignore` for cross-package use.
- Documentation updated with clearer guidance on gitignore template format, wizard behavior, and troubleshooting MCP server startup on macOS.

## v0.6.0 - 2026-02-03

### Added
- Documentation website with comprehensive guides covering getting started, concepts (approvals, MCP servers, project memory, version pinning), reference (CLI, configuration, environment variables), and troubleshooting.
- Website publishing pipeline (`cmd/publish-site`) with automated deployment in the release workflow.
- Playwright MCP server template in default `config.toml` for browser automation workflows.
- Descriptive comments for all default MCP server templates explaining purpose and required credentials.
- Claude Code VS Code Extension added to supported clients table in README.

### Changed
- README rewritten with clearer value proposition, comparison table (manual vs Agent Layer), and improved quick start flow.
- Default MCP server examples in README now use generic `example-api` instead of GitHub-specific config for clarity.
- Documentation structure consolidated from nested pages to flat MDX files for better navigation.

## v0.5.8 - 2026-01-30

### Changed
- **Breaking:** Environment variables now require `AL_` prefix to avoid conflicts with shell environment (e.g., `GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` → `AL_GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN`). This ensures Agent Layer variables don't override existing environment variables when VS Code terminals inherit the process environment.

### Fixed
- VS Code `open-vscode.app` launcher now uses `osascript` with a login shell (`zsh -l`) instead of hardcoded VS Code CLI paths, fixing launch failures when VS Code is installed via Homebrew, in `~/Applications`, or other non-standard locations. This also fixes MCP server failures where VS Code couldn't find `node` because Finder-launched apps have a minimal PATH.
- All VS Code launchers (`.app`, `.command`, `.bat`, `.desktop`) now delegate to `al vscode` for loading `.agent-layer/.env`, ensuring consistent parsing (KEY=VALUE data, not sourced) across platforms. Only `AL_*` variables with non-empty values are loaded, and existing environment variables take precedence—matching the documented behavior for `al` commands.
- VS Code `.app` launcher now shows a descriptive alert when the `code` command is not found, instead of silently failing.
- Linux `.desktop` launcher simplified to delegate to `.command` script for consistent behavior and maintainability.

## v0.5.7 - 2026-01-29

### Added
- Custom HTTP header support for Codex MCP servers: `bearer_token_env_var` for `Authorization: Bearer ${VAR}`, `env_http_headers` for other env-var-sourced headers, and `http_headers` for static literals.
- `X-MCP-Tools` header in default GitHub MCP server template for server-side tool filtering, reducing projected tool count.
- Detailed per-tool token breakdown in `al doctor` MCP schema bloat warnings, showing top contributors by token count.
- Documentation for MCP HTTP header projection across all supported clients (`docs/MCP_HEADERS_SUPPORT.md`).

### Changed
- Default MCP schema token thresholds increased to accommodate larger MCP servers (server: 7500→20000 tokens, total: 10000→30000 tokens).
- Doctor command now shows real-time discovery progress when checking MCP servers.
- Large internal modules (`install`, `dispatch`, `config`) split into smaller, focused files for maintainability.
- golangci-lint upgraded to v2.8.0 with additional linting rules enabled.

## v0.5.6 - 2026-01-27

### Added
- `http_transport` config option for HTTP MCP servers to specify transport mode (`streamable` or `sse`).
- Three new MCP server templates in default `config.toml`: `fetch` (mcp-server-fetch), `ripgrep` (mcp-ripgrep), and `filesystem` (server-filesystem with repo-scoped access).
- `${AL_REPO_ROOT}` built-in variable for resolving repository root path in MCP server args.
- VS Code settings sync now preserves existing user settings and comments using JSONC-aware block insertion instead of overwriting the entire file.
- Memory file templates (`BACKLOG.md`, `COMMANDS.md`, `DECISIONS.md`, `ISSUES.md`, `ROADMAP.md`) now include detailed formatting guidelines and entry templates.

### Changed
- MCP projection refactored: new `internal/projection/resolvers.go` module centralizes server resolution logic, used by both sync and warning checks.
- Update-available warning now includes full upgrade instructions for Homebrew, macOS/Linux shell script, and Windows PowerShell.
- Instruction templates consolidated and shortened to reduce token count while preserving key guidelines.
- Terminal detection moved to canonical `internal/terminal` package with `IsInteractive()` function.
- Default MCP server templates no longer specify `clients` filter (servers are projected to all clients by default).

### Fixed
- MCP server health checks now properly handle HTTP transport timeout scenarios.

## v0.5.5 - 2026-01-25

### Added
- New `03_tools.md` instruction template with comprehensive tool usage guidelines: time-sensitive information handling, Context7 documentation lookups, MCP tool constraints, approval workflows, and error handling.
- New `fix-tests` slash command runs repo-defined checks (lint/format/pre-commit/tests) in a loop, fixing failures until all checks pass or max iterations reached.

### Changed
- Temporary artifact location moved from `tmp/agent-layer/runs/` to `.agent-layer/tmp/runs/`, keeping all agent artifacts within `.agent-layer/`.
- Slash command artifact naming standardized across workflows: `.agent-layer/tmp/<workflow>.<run-id>.<type>.md` with `run-id = YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS-<short-rand>`. User path overrides removed for consistency.
- `finish-task` workflow now delegates to `fix-tests` when available before falling back to manual repo-defined commands.
- README updated with new artifact naming convention and VS Code reauthentication note for new `CODEX_HOME` environments.

## v0.5.4 - 2026-01-24

### Changed
- Memory file `FEATURES.md` renamed to `BACKLOG.md` to better reflect its purpose (unscheduled user-visible features and tasks vs deferred issues).
- `al init --overwrite` now detects and prompts to delete unknown files under `.agent-layer` that are not tracked by Agent Layer templates.
- `al init --force` now deletes unknown files under `.agent-layer` in addition to overwriting existing files without prompts.
- Memory instruction templates improved with clearer formatting rules and entry layouts.
- Slash command templates (`continue-roadmap.md`, `update-roadmap.md`) simplified and clarified.
- VS Code launcher paths centralized in `internal/launchers` package, consumed by sync and install to prevent drift.
- Sync package refactored with system abstraction layer for improved test isolation and reliability.

## v0.5.3 - 2026-01-24

### Changed
- User-facing strings consolidated into `internal/messages/` package for consistency and maintainability.
- Python release tools (`extract-checksum.py`, `update-formula.py`) replaced with Go implementations in `internal/tools/`.
- Release test script reorganized into modular components (`scripts/test-release/release_tests.sh`, `scripts/test-release/tool_tests.sh`).
- Slash command templates (`find-issues.md`, `finish-task.md`) simplified to reduce duplication with base instructions; formatting rules now delegate to individual memory file templates.

## v0.5.2 - 2026-01-24

### Added
- Automated Homebrew tap updates: release workflow now opens a PR against `conn-castle/homebrew-tap` to update the formula with the new tarball URL and SHA256.

## v0.5.1 - 2026-01-23

### Added
- Source tarball (`agent-layer-<version>.tar.gz`) published with releases for Homebrew formula support.

### Changed
- Release scripts now generate and verify the source tarball via `git archive` + `gzip -n`.
- Documentation cleanup: simplified release process, corrected `make dev` description.

## v0.5.0 - 2026-01-23

Major shift from repo-local binary to globally installed CLI with per-repo version pinning.

### Added
- Global CLI installation via Homebrew (`brew install conn-castle/tap/agent-layer`), shell script (macOS/Linux), or PowerShell (Windows).
- `al init` command initializes `.agent-layer/` and `docs/agent-layer/` in any repo.
- Per-repo version pinning via `.agent-layer/al.version`; global CLI dispatches to the pinned version automatically.
- Cached binary downloads with SHA-256 verification; cached binaries stored in `~/.cache/agent-layer/versions/`.
- Shell completion for bash, zsh, and fish (`al completion <shell>` with optional `--install` flag).
- Update checking: `al init` and `al doctor` warn when a newer release is available.
- Linux desktop entry launcher (`.agent-layer/open-vscode.desktop`).
- E2E test suite (`scripts/test-e2e.sh`) and release test script (`scripts/test-release.sh`).
- Environment variables: `AL_CACHE_DIR` (override cache location), `AL_VERSION` (force version), `AL_NO_NETWORK` (disable downloads).

### Changed
- **Breaking:** Repo-local `./al` executable replaced with globally installed `al` CLI.
- **Breaking:** `al install` renamed to `al init`.
- **Breaking:** Repository moved from `nicholasjconn/agent-layer` to `conn-castle/agent-layer`.
- Install script renamed from `agent-layer-install.sh` to `al-install.sh`.
- `al init --overwrite` now prompts before each overwrite; use `--force` to skip prompts.
- `al init --version <tag>` pins the repo to a specific release version.
- Commands run from any subdirectory now resolve the repo root automatically.
- `.agent-layer/.gitignore` added to ignore launchers, template copies, and backups.

### Removed
- Repo-local `./al` binary; global `al` dispatches to pinned versions as needed.
- `agent-layer-install.sh` (replaced by `al-install.sh`).

## v0.4.0 - 2026-01-21

### Added
- `al doctor` command reports missing secrets, disabled servers, and common misconfigurations.
- `al wizard` command provides interactive setup for approval modes, agent enablement, model selection, MCP servers, secrets, and warning thresholds.
- Configurable warning system with thresholds for instruction token count, MCP server/tool counts, and schema token sizes.
- Antigravity slash commands now generate skills in `.agent/skills/<command>/SKILL.md`.
- VS Code launchers: macOS `.app` bundle (no Terminal window), macOS `.command` script, and Windows `.bat` file, all with `CODEX_HOME` support.
- `al install --no-wizard` flag skips the post-install wizard prompt.
- Atomic file writes across all sync operations prevent partial file corruption.

### Changed
- `al install` now prompts to run the wizard after seeding files (interactive terminals only).
- Gitignore patterns use root-anchored paths (`/AGENTS.md` instead of `AGENTS.md`) for precision.
- Default Codex reasoning effort changed from `xhigh` to `high`.
- Codex config header now warns about potential secrets in generated files.
- Environment variable loading: process environment takes precedence; `.agent-layer/.env` fills missing keys only; empty values in `.env` are ignored.
- Improved instruction and slash-command templates.

### Fixed
- VS Code launcher now works correctly with proper error messages for missing `code` command.
- MCP configuration for Codex HTTP servers now handles bearer token environment variables correctly.

## v0.3.1 - 2026-01-19

### Added
- Installer failure output now includes clear, actionable error messages.

### Fixed
- Installer checksum verification now handles SHA256SUMS entries with "./" prefixes.

### Changed
- Quick start documentation no longer suggests manual install fallback when only `./al` is present.

## v0.3.0 - 2026-01-18

Complete rewrite in Go for simpler installation and fewer moving parts.

### Added
- Single repo-local Go binary (`./al`) replaces the Node.js codebase.
- `al install` command for repository initialization with template seeding.
- `al install --overwrite` flag to reset templates to defaults.
- `al sync` command to regenerate client configs without launching.
- Support for five clients: Gemini CLI, Claude Code CLI, VS Code/Copilot Chat, Codex CLI, and Antigravity.
- Unified `[[mcp.servers]]` configuration in `config.toml` for both HTTP and stdio transports.
- Approval modes (`all`, `mcp`, `commands`, `none`) with per-client projection.
- `${ENV_VAR}` substitution from `.agent-layer/.env` with client-specific placeholder syntax preservation.
- Internal MCP prompt server for slash command discovery (auto-wired into client configs).
- Golden-file tests for deterministic output validation.
- Managed `.gitignore` block with customizable template (`.agent-layer/gitignore.block`).

### Changed
- **Breaking:** Complete rewrite from Node.js to Go.
- **Breaking:** Configuration moved from `config/agents.json` to `.agent-layer/config.toml` (TOML format).
- **Breaking:** MCP servers now configured via `[[mcp.servers]]` arrays in `config.toml`.
- CLI simplified: `./al <client>` always syncs then launches.
- Instructions now in `.agent-layer/instructions/` (numbered markdown files, lexicographic order).
- Slash commands now in `.agent-layer/slash-commands/` (one markdown file per command).
- Approved commands now in `.agent-layer/commands.allow` (one prefix per line).
- Project memory standardized in `docs/agent-layer/` (ISSUES.md, FEATURES.md, ROADMAP.md, DECISIONS.md, COMMANDS.md).

### Removed
- Node.js codebase (`src/lib/*.mjs`, test files, `package.json`).
- `config/agents.json` and separate MCP server configuration files.
- Built-in Tavily MCP server (now configurable as external server in `config.toml`).

## v0.2.0 - 2026-01-17

Major architectural overhaul moving core logic from shell to Node.js.

### Added
- Per-agent opt-in configuration via `config/agents.json` with interactive setup prompt.
- HTTP transport support for MCP servers.
- Tavily MCP server for web search capabilities.
- `./al --version` flag with dirty suffix for non-tagged commits.
- User config preservation and backup during upgrades.

### Changed
- **Breaking:** CLI entrypoint is now `.agent-layer/agent-layer`; `./al` remains as the launcher wrapper in the parent root.
- Root resolution, environment loading, and cleanup moved from shell to Node.js (`src/lib/roots.mjs`, `src/lib/env.mjs`, `src/lib/cleanup.mjs`).
- Test framework migrated from Bats (shell) to Node.js native test runner.
- GitHub MCP server switched to hosted HTTP endpoint with PAT authentication.
- Architecture documentation updated to reflect new layer boundaries.

### Removed
- Shell scripts: `al`, `run.sh`, `setup.sh`, `clean.sh`, `check-updates.sh`, `open-vscode.command`.
- Shell-based root resolution: `src/lib/parent-root.sh`, `src/lib/temp-parent-root.sh`.

## v0.1.0 - 2026-01-12
Initial release.

### Added
- Installer for per-project setup that pins `.agent-layer/` to tagged releases, with upgrade, version, and dev-branch options.
- Repo-local `./al` launcher with sync and environment modes plus local update checks.
- Sync pipeline that generates client configs from `.agent-layer/config` sources.
- MCP prompt server that exposes workflows as prompts.
- Project memory templates and setup/bootstrap helpers.
